The apartment was spotless, well-equipped, and exactly as described. The location was perfect — close to everything yet peaceful and relaxing. The hosts were incredibly friendly, responsive, and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.<br/>Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. We’d definitely love to come back again!\",\"Fantastic stay at Broadbeach, amazing location and the condo was fully equipped with very comfortable beds. The place was squeaky clean and the Tim Tams on arrival was a cute thought. They’d really thought of everything that you’d need during the stay and we couldn’t have wanted anything more. Thanks again, we will definitely stay again!\",\"Amazing location walking distance to prestine beach, restaurants, cafes and ice cream shops with Woolworths literally next door. The accommodation itself was modernly furnished with great amenities and super clean. The service provided by Broadbeach Luxury Stays from inquiry to check-in was second to none. highly recommended.\",\"A great compact, modern apartment with excellent facilities.  Main bedroom great size with views and sliding doors which allow good breeze to flow through.  2nd bedroom has no window but is a good size.  Bathroom is jack and jill style - comfy bath to relax in and plenty of space for toiletries.  Well equipped kitchenette and laundry.  Walkable to Pacific Fair and restaurants in Broadie.  An enjoyable stay.  Would stay again.\",\"Amazing stay. <br/>All boxes ticked. Cleanliness, location, communication and comfort. Enjoyed our stay.\",\"From the check in through to the departure everything was just beautiful. The apartment has everything you need and it’s lovely sitting outside on the balcony enjoying the weather. The hosts were very helpful and provided a personal check in. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.\",\"it is rare to enter a property and immediately feel a sense of warmth and  comfort. It is also not often to find a property that ends up being better than the pics. Karin was extremely welcoming and informative. <br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all.our needs were provided for. <br/>The level of cleanliness is 5 star. We will certainly be returning.\",\"Great unit in the heart of Broadbeach. Kitchen facilities are handy. Located on level 6, room 608. Parking was in basement level 3. Cafe downstairs was very nice and convenient. <br/>It was fine for us but the main bedroom has a wall of frosted glass between the bathroom. No curtain so light at night lights up main bedroom. Would recommend a blind or curtain.\",\"Fantastic! Quite at night but still just a walk to everything\",\"Lovely decorated apartment that is very well stocked with all the essentials you need.<br/>Fantastic local\",\"The apartment was one of the best I have stayed in so clean beds were so comfortable they have thought of everything you would need it's a fantastic location for beach restaurants shopping had the best time thanks fir having us Cathy Alex  from New zealand\",\"We absolutely loved our four night stay. The check-in process with Karin was great and the unit itself was wonderful and in a terrific location. Could not recommend more highly.\",\"We were two colleagues, going to a conference at the conference centre. The location was great for this, being very walkable, with several cafes between the two. The beach was also a short walk away so this was a perfect location for us. The apartment has the bathroom in between the two bedrooms, so some bathroom door closure protocols had to be established between the two of us and it was fine. There is a big glass window between the bathroom and big bedroom, but the frosting on the glass reduces the view into the bathroom. There is one big bedroom with great views and one small bedroom without windows which can be dark. Cleanliness and functionality of everything was great. Would happily stay again.\",\"Highly recommend this apartment! Super comfortable space with lots of natural light! Great location 3 minute walk to the beach and host was responsive and met us for checkin. Would stay here again, thank you!\",\"Great place to stay highly recommend this property\",\"Great location, amazing hosts. Would stay again\",\"This is a lovely apartment to stay.

A major attraction in the area is the fully restored amazing and historic Port Welshpool Long Jetty...a must visit family friendly jetty with beautiful safe beach surrounds. You can be as busy as you wish or relaxed as you may need:) there are so many things to do and see for adults and kids alike including great fishing, lovely safe beaches as well as bike tracks or if you like to walk or hike there are so many beautiful unspoilt areas for all to enjoy all within easy reach of Melbourne. Come stay and enjoy at a price we have set so a break is affordable to all -all we ask is that you treat the house as your own and respect the rate we charge and in return please clean on departure. Many thanks!The house has beautiful wooden cathedral ceilings with delightful character. Recently fully renovated with a new kitchen, bathroom and furnishings. A reverse cycle air conditioner for summer and winter comfort and great heating for those cosy winter nights and there is also a wood heater (so sorry wood not provided now as it would weirdly \"disappear\" when we did) There is a large lounge / open living plan with new kitchen with absolutely everything you will need along with microwave, ceramic cooktop,  Aldi Coffee maker and lots of bench space and walk in pantry. There is a 50” Ultra HD TV along with the Foxtel Entertainment Package which includes 9 Sports Channels for the boys (including Fox Sports) plus STAN for your enjoyment ...and FREE WIFITwo good size bedrooms one with a comfy queen bed (including 37\" TV in the main bedroom) and the other with a double bed and a single so comfortably sleeps 5.Along 2 full sides of the house is a delightful covered verandah that gets lots of sun and shade (not to mention the peaceful outlook lovely to view the native birds and a lovely area to have breakie or have a drink or BBQ in the eve- there is a gas BBQ available. We have several board games to play which we often do!! If you have a boat there is lots of room on the large easily accessible corner block with the store (great fish and chips), the beach and jetty just a few minutes walk away. – So bring the kids fishing rods!NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen, towels and toiletries etc (everything else is there incl shampoo body wash, hand soaps, toilet rolls etc) and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)PETS: Also please note (and sorry) we do not allow pets after three VERY bad experiences. We used to welcome the family pet as we have animals ourselves, but many dollars later with repairs we have had to make due to irresponsible people we have now changed our policy - apologies to all the responsible pet owners out there.ATTRACTIONS IN THE AREA (and Things to do just to name a few)The brand new and famous (now totally restored) Port Welshpool Long JettyA lovely kid’s safe beachWhale Watching cruises leave from Port Welshpool (seasonal)Wilsons PromAgnes FallsToora Wind FarmTarra Bulga National Park – Wow!Port Albert (Historic Fishing Village)Lovely Cafes in Toora, Foster and YarramGreat Fishing and Swimming Wildlife galoreLovely Walkways, bike tracks and Tramping optionsHistoric Museums WELCOME TO PORT WELSHPOOL -VICTORIAS SECRET A LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVENThe Port and surrounds Port Welshpool is a lovely drive of about 90 minutes from Cranbourne once you hit the Sth Gippsland Highway and is in an undiscovered \"peaceful paradise\" just a short drive from beautiful and unspoilt Wilsons Prom. We own our lovely \"home away from home\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \"The Port\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.Guest accessEntire houseOther things to noteNOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)</td><td>Stays</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>[\"It’s a nice peaceful place to get away from busy city life.

Can't stress enough...Extremely good value reduced to simply treat their house like you would your own (and we stayed in high holiday season when caravan parks were costly). We had a lovely intimate family Christmas escape from the city to the fresh air and quiet peaceful surrounds. Check out the general store for some great fish and chips too! Kerry, Jo and Ezra are fabulous hosts responding quickly (even over Christmas) to any questions and providing a wealth of information on the area which is also listed in a binder on arrival.

We own our lovely \\\"home away from home\\\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \\\"The Port\\\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.\"},{\"title\":\"Guest access\",\"value\":\"Entire house\"},{\"title\":\"Other things to note\",\"value\":\"NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \\\"relaxees\\\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)\"}]</td><td>\n",

In the same time, it is a quiet place with an amazing view of the forest behind the city walls towards the White Tower.The place is located in one of the iconic historical buildings in Brasov. It was built in the 18th Century on the old City walls(you can still see the old city wall from the window) and the building was used as a the main eye hospital in Transilvania.The spaceThe apartment was designed in a way that it keeps some of its' older vibe, but in the same time provide its' guests with the highest level of comfort possible.Since the ceilings are so high, we took advantage of this for the first bedroom where we designed a whole structure so that we can have the bed on an upper level, thus taking advantage of the space below where we set up a small desk and some storage spaces. We also welcome you to the round table, which is a perfect place to have some fun with your family or friends. This space also works as a living room since it's exactly above the entrance of the apartment in a common accessed area For the other bedroom, given the size of the room, we went for large pieces of furniture, trying also to keep a more vintage aspect to it and not overcrowd the room.  You will immediately notice the old wood stove in the corner which towers and looks over the whole room from the corner.The kitchen and the bathroom are both fully equipped for any of your needs, and we also wanted to make sure that both of them have something special to offer to our guests from a design perspective. You will notice the old wood stove in the bathroom as it is has been transformed to encompass the sink area.Guest accessFor parking you have one available 100 meters away. Given the central location I highly recommend you ditch the car and explore the city by foot. There is also a bus station close by to explore other parts of the city, and if you enjoy skiing during winter, or just want to have a stroll, the bus station towards Poiana Brasov is only 500 meters away.</td><td>Stays</td><td>false</td><td>null</td><td>[\"Lovely apartment, clean and suited a family of four. Our kids are 9 and 11 and enjoyed the mezzanine bed. Very tastefully decorated and close to main square in Brasov.\",\"We arrive from the airport and it was about 15 minutes walk. Sobway/metro was just around the corner. had a few restaurants within walking distance. overall good\",\"The Apartment was advertised as a 2 bedrooms apartment. In reality  our 2 grownup kids had to crawl to the matress up in the gallery/attic. We  filled our kids age in the filling forms. It was clear that our children are grownups. Yet the apartment was promoted as a 2 bedrooms apartment suitable for 4 persons. The second room was not a bedroom, but rather a dinning room with a mattress  at the attic. Not suitable for adult grownup children. Our children didn't sleep well in a suitable bed and it ruined all our stay. We think it would be appropriate to be truthfull with the advertisement and discription of the apartment. Not suitable for a familly with big children.\",\"Pros: absolutely stunning apartment, fantastic decorations, very clean, comfortable beds, large TV, close to main square (2 min walk), easy access, friendly staff, responsive owner, large bathroom<br/>Cons: thin walls and next door Airbnb has a piano which guests played at 1am, second bedroom on mezzanine above main front door not that private and could get noise from squeaky floors\",\"I stayed here for three days and absolutely loved it. The place is wonderful—cozy, intimate, beautifully designed, and very practical. It has a special charm, with heritage pieces that give it a unique and refined atmosphere. It’s the kind of place you can’t wait to return to.<br/>During my stay, I had three days of work and found the space very conducive to productivity. Unfortunately, on the first day, there was a lot of noise from a team of workers nearby, which disrupted my focus. However, the hosts were incredibly attentive and welcoming. As soon as I mentioned the issue, they promptly took care of it, and from the second day onwards, it was perfectly quiet.<br/>I’m very grateful for their hospitality and care and would definitely come back again for both work and leisure. A truly special place!\",\"So beautiful my wife asked how do we buy this place as soon as we walked in. Hard with parking and a family though as summer in Brasov is busy and not always lots of parking. But the place itself is amazing.  My son loved sleeping in the loft bed which was an awesome experience\",\"We had an amazing stay in this beautiful apartment. The bedroom is stunning. Right in the centre of town. Highly recommend.\",\"An absolutely beautiful flat, nicer than the photos in the listing. Very comfortable, set back from the street and very quiet with a lovely view of trees.\",\"Great apartment in a great location with a gorgeous kitchen and main bedroom.\",\"Really beautiful place! We had a great time. It is in an ideal location\",\"Andreis Flat is just beautiful. We really felt like home and would for sure come again!\",\"Clean spacious place. Close to everything!\",\"Amazing stay, central location and nice restaurants.\",\"Great place…perfect location\",\"I recommend it.\",\"Everything went great! :)\",\"The apartment is as shown in the pictures! Very spacious, tidy and tastefully decorated. Outstanding location. Andrei very friendly and antento. Highly recommended! :)\",\"What a great accommodation! It is right next to the old square and the master bedroom has a gorgeous view of the White Tower and a lush green backyard full of cherry trees. The master is like a bedroom for royalty. Large and spacious to the extreme. The second bedroom is more of a platform bed, rather than a room itself. The kitchen has the basic necessities for morning coffee and scrambled eggs\uD83D\uDE0A. There are many great restaurants within a short walking distance. Andrei was super responsive and flexible with our checkin time. I highly recommend this Airbnb\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB\",\"Fantastic two night stay at Cuba apartment. Beautifully decorated. Spotlessly clean. Warm and cozy despite the snow outside . Great views from the windows of the Brasov sign and white tower. Very responsive hosts . <br/>The perfect location to stay  in beautiful Brasov square.  I highly recommend and will definitely return to Brasov and stay here again .\",\"This is a wonderful spacious apartment, beautifully furnished, quite location, super clean and airy, in the heart of Brasov. Andrei is a gem! He was  incredibly helpful, kind, and attentive to our needs.<br/>The weather wasn't the greatest but Andrei's place made this trip one to remember.<br/>Thank you ever so much, Andrei!<br/>Looking forward to visiting again some time soon!\",\"We are Romanians living abroad, returning to our country for vacations as often as we can. Brasov and the surrounding areas are some of our favourite places to be. <br/>We tried a good few places in Brasov, but this one is hands down the best of them all! <br/>I love how they carefully saved the architecture of the building, the old fireplaces with museum worthy features and the wooden floors. <br/>You can see that’s someone is taking great care of this place. <br/>Highly recommended!!!\",\"I travelled for 3 weeks across Netherlands, Austria and Romania and this was by far the best place we stayed at. Well designed, lots of space, high ceilings, big bathroom space, everything was great. Even the view from the window while it snowed was magical. While Andrei helped us on chat, we met one of the hosts in person - Toni and had some great conversations. Toni set us up with a great guide/host who took us around all the castles. Overall an amazing experience and a great space and right next to the town square.\",\"The apartment is right in the heart of the old town center. Everything you would want to visit or see is in walking distance. <br/>From the bedroom you have a great view of the White Tower. From the living room you can see the top of the Tampa mountain with the BRASOV sign, over the rooftops.  <br/>The kitchen is top modern and the bathroom is huge. The bedroom is enormous. Everything looks exactly as in the pictures.\",\"We rented this space for the 4 of us. We got there and we were so impressed by the interior design, everything is newly renovated, a mix of modern but with rustic colours, well thought. Also the romanian traditional heaters (soba) were kept in, so impressed and appreciated. <br/>The beds are comfortable. The big bedroom is really huge, we loved it! <br/>The location is best you can get, right in the heart of the city. <br/>Highly recommend this!

Michalis greeted us and shared recommendations for the best restaurants, beaches, etc on Paros and Antiparos which was super helpful! The house is only 10 minute walk from the village which gave us privacy and amazing views. The house is well equipped and clean. The back terrace was our favorite place to hang out in the evenings while watching the sunset.\",\"Absolutely loved our stay! Spacious and very clean, one room is completely separate which was great for the couples to have their own areas and the amenities were perfect! Great for families or couples!\",\"We had a great time at Michalis's place, very welcoming host and available anytime. The place was in pristine condition with all the necessary amenities. A breathtaking sea view in the middle of nature . We highly recommend your place to stay. No negative points.\",\"Wounderful stay. Amazing house with a lot of space and everything you need to unwind and just relax! Very friendly and welcoming host. Highly recommended!\",\"Nice people <br/>Helpful <br/>Slightly out of the way however nice privacy \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\",\"Perfect accommodation, spacious and comfortable, with a wonderful terrace for after-dinner drinks. Everything was great\",\"We felt at home. Michalis and his wife were always available to help us, very responsive but most of all very very sweet! The house was beautiful and clean and has a breathtaking view. They left water, wine, local olive oil and anything we could need for the beach as well. So many nice touches. We were a group of friends and I hope to take my family here one day. Thank you both!\",\"Very good hosting by Michalis, full of good advice. Perfect house. Very nice place.\",\"Beautiful home, breathtaking views, 5-10 min walk to Aliki, its beautiful beaches and delicious waterfront restaurants. A place we highly recommend, much nicer than the more touristy towns of Parikia or Naoussa. Very comfortable bedding, very well-equipped kitchen, impeccable cleanliness, beach chairs and umbrella very much appreciated. And Michalis is very available, kind, enthusiastic, generous with his time and information. Is there any better compliment?<br/>Thanks for everything.\",\"Everything was perfect, the house is very clean and beautiful, with a nice area in front of the house that has a stunning view on the sea. Michelis and his wife are very nice hosts, trying to make everything they can to make you enjoy your stay. Definitely a place I recomand !\",\"The villa fits comfortably the needs of 6 adults.The place is quiet and the seaview as well as sunset view are superb.The cleanliness of the villa and the kindness of the host are both strong arguments to recommend the villa.\",\"Great stay, the house is superb and we were able to enjoy the outdoors and the garden.<br/>Our host was very nice and available. I would recommend this place, close to the center and easy to access. Thank you\",\"This is exactly what all Airbnb experiences should be like. The perfect stay in a dream villa. The warm host Michalis took care of every need and surprised us along the way. The villa is very spacious with amazing views. It is impeccably clean, and the terrace is a gorgeous place to spend your evening with a Greek wine overlooking the Aegean. I have stayed in villas around the world and I don't have a single piece of feedback - I can only recommend it to whoever reads this message.\",\"We visited Villa Theros in August. The house is even better than the photos. It is brand new. It is decorated with taste and character. It is fully equipped and has a great BBQ spot. The verandas are amazing with a great view. The garden is very well maintained. Our daughter loved collecting figs from the trees. We really appreciated that the surrounding area was peaceful. The owners were great and welcoming. Communication before arrival was really good and precise. So sad we couldn't stay longer! We will definitely go back again!\",\"An Airbnb can not get better in our opinion. If we were ever to own one we would model it after what Michalis and his wife have created. It was perfection for us. Loved the location and the peace and quiet. Yet it is only a short walk to shops and restaurants. What a delightful find... it was our favorite place in Greece.\",\"Michalis’ villa exceeded our expectations in every way. He’s house was so well appointed thought out and tastefully designed with everything we needed in the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms . There is an amazing outdoor kitchen and gorgeous back deck with the most amazing sunsets and views . There was also a  fruit and vegetable garden we could pick from to add to our breakfasts and dinners. Every moment in the day was tranquil and picturesque with unobstructed views of the surrounding hills and oceans.<br/>Michalis was a kind and generous host and supplied us everything we could need . He had  lists, maps and tours all ready for us. If you are thinking about coming to Paros please consider staying at Michalis Villa , PARADISE !!!\",\"We stayed at Villa Theros as a group of six for nine days in September. <br/>I cannot reccommend it enough. The accommodation is spacious, tasteful, equipped with everything you could possibly need and it is brand new. <br/>It is in a peaceful yet convenient location about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the local village and beaches. The views over the surrounding are and sea are amazing. Michalis and Vaso were so friendly, fantastic hosts and seriously went above and beyond to ensure our experience was the best possible. Their advice on where to explore on the island was also invaluable. <br/>Overall, a fantastic experience and would not hesitate to return.\",\"5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH for this home.   You will love it, no question.  It is wonderfully renovated, exquisitely decorated, generously hosted, thoroughly supplied, and strategically located.  It is quiet and relaxing, perfect inside/out, and offers glorious views of country, sea, and town.    You will adore this home, we can guarantee it.  Our credentials to review are bolstered by at least 100 previous rental experiences in countries around the world.  This home brought together the best of all of those experiences, and none of the bad.  Many places we have stayed before have had lovely views, but poor renovation or equipping.  That was not the case here, it is the full package and leaves absolutely nothing to be desired.   The quality of the renovation is impeccable, carefully considered, and obviously the fruit of professional architects and interior designers.  That is only the beginning.  The furnishing and decoration are attractive, subtle, and practical.   The kitchen is a gift to travelers like us that have spent too much time in other rentals looking for sharp knives, cutting boards, oil/salts, or other simple and obvious things.  The hosts have handled the basic, and gone above and beyond to a degree that made us feel perfectly at home, and their concern and thoroughness was truly amazing.    As for the hosts, Michalis and Vaso are extremely kind, generous, friendly, and warm.  The home-made olive oil, jams, and freshly picked grapes and figs were delicious.   5 Stars is not enough.  This is the Greek Home You have always wanted.\",\"We were 4 adults and stayed in Villa Theros during May. We were really happy with our choice, the house is trully amazing. <br/>It is very clean and beautiful, the decoration is simple and tasteful and it is equipped with all things necessary. The balconies are large with a relaxing sea view. We really loved the fact that it is quiet and it has a large garden with trees and flowers. To our view the location is ideal because it is away from the everyday business of the town yet close enough to easily walk to the nearby beaches and the restaurants. The owners made us feel welcome and they were very kind and discreet. Overall we definitely recommend it and we will try to come back for a longer stay next time! <br/>Ευχαριστούμε πολύ για τη φιλοξενία!!\",\"The Villa is newly refurbished with all modern comforts, very clean and the owner is wonderfully helpful and quick in reply to any question.\",\"We had a great holiday at Villa Theros. Beautiful house and very comfortable because in addition to being in a lovely location, the furnishings and attention to detail  have made our stay super pleasant. Excellent cleaning and the presence of many accessories both in the kitchen and extra such as deckchairs and umbrellas to take to the beach.  And what about the owners who stay in the house next door: a mix of kindness, availability and friendliness.<br/>Super recommended !!! We will definitely be back!\",\"The house is perfectly as described: new, very well equipped and very comfortable. Michalis and his wife's welcome was exceptional, punctuated by small touches throughout our stay. They were perfect hosts, with great kindness, shared by many Greeks.

She also provided great dining recommendations! The apartment was perfect. Honestly even better in person than even the photos!  views of the beach and castle were perfect. Our only negative is we didn't stay long enough!\",\"We had a great time. Ana and her husband were very good hosts. We went with a girl of almost 4 years, and it was great, the beach right next door, restaurants, the promenade for afternoon walks... The apartment was very good, with all the amenities we were looking for. Everything was wonderful! I would recommend it without hesitation. Thanks guys, thanks to both of you!\",\"The apartment is very comfortable and very well located.<br/>Highly recommended, we'll definitely be back\",\"Very nice accommodation located facing the sea, very good bedding.

Also, Ana is a very welcoming host and willing to help. 100% recommended!\",\"We stayed at Ana's place for our last night of 19 days of traveling through Spain and  wished we could have stayed longer! The weather was not great with a record-breaking DANA in Spain, but the rain broke for just enough time to walk up to the castle and see the beach. Ana was beyond kind and caring, especially in light of the DANA which had caused significant flooding in the Valencian region. She reached out ahead of time to be sure we were safe and offered to release us of our booking if we felt unsafe with traveling and cared enough to be sure we made it safely to the airport after leaving. The apartment was perfect! We especially loved the fully equipped kitchen, balconies, and having the garage right below the building to load/unload our luggage in bad weather. I highly recommend Ana's place! I wanted to give her a big hug for her kindness in a stressful time.\",\"A great well equipped apartment right next to the beach, will definitely stay again in the future.\",\"Very nice apartment, tastefully renovated, with sea views that you don't get tired of,  and partial views of Peniscola Castle from the balcony.

I was remotely working during that time and we are 2 people. Since we had already explored the island we had returned our car after reaching here.<br/>Pros:<br/>- The apartment is big so you need a large space that is useful.<br/>- The building has some good history and it really feels nice.<br/>- The location is great. It is right in the center of everything and also reachable by car (which isn't true for many other places)<br/>- Airbnb wise everything was available and comfortable. Christina is a great person and she was very responsive and helped us checkin and even gave us tips.<br/>Cons:<br/>There were some minor things you might want to weight if relevant:<br/>- The wifi is 5mbps so it might not work great if you are working remotely.<br/>- Because the facade is historic the apartment isn't very well lit from sunlight if that's preference for you.\",\"Kristina was very friendly. She reached out proactively and made sure our check was smooth. We had a full platter of fruits, home made jam, liquor and cookies waiting on us, which was as pleasant surprise!<br/>The place is right beside the harbor and all the shops, restaurants in old town. Great location and still quiet. The terrace is a great place to have coffee in the morning. Loved our stay!! Thanks Kristina!!\",\"We loved this apartment and its location right in the old town, steps from the Venetian port.<br/>It’s a peaceful oasis in the busy area: very quiet inside, Air conditioning, comfortable beds, 3 full bathrooms and large living areas. Nice rooftop with table, chairs, and lounge chairs. Clothes washer is a really nice plus, laundry soap is provided.<br/>Christina is very responsive, gave us a map and recommended restaurants, and left us a welcome gift. When we asked, she brought us a second set of keys which was helpful.<br/>The only possible negative is the stairs if you have mobility issues.<br/>Xania is delightful. We would definitely stay here again.\",\"Perfect place. Walking distance to the port with all restaurants and shops. Great place for a small family of 5-6. The only request is to change the TV to smart TV so we can share the smart phone screen and watch Netflix. Other than that everyone was perfect.\",\"Location was wonderful as far as walkable to many restaurants and shops. The home is clean and the AC works great. Has nice kitchen area however we never did cook. <br/>Only Con:  noise levels. The first bedroom we could hear our neighbors who were very loud the first 2 nights until they left. The bathroom door needs to be shut as sounds through the vents from outside restaurant and bar comes through. The upstairs bedroom my brother and his wife had and said they could hear the music from the bar if you are a light sleeper.\",\"We had an amazing time in Crete at this Airbnb! The home was beautiful and very clean and in an amazing location. The host was very friendly and if I were to ever go back to Chania I would definitely choose this place to stay!\",\"Beautiful apartment in the perfect location of old town. Highly recommend. Very accommodating host, especially with our 9 month old.\",\"We had an excellent stay - great location, very private and clean. The terrace was lovely. Would definitely stay again!\",\"Eva was a great host and easy to communicate with. Her home was clean and in a great location.\",\"Location location location!! Super comfy accommodation in an amazing location. Can’t wait to visit again!!!\",\"Fantastic stay! The room was clean, spacious, and well-decorated. Great amenities and convenient location. Highly recommend!\",\"Had a lovely stay in this great cosy Airbnb. The location is super convenient next to a lively street with plenty to see and eat. Highly recommend this spot!\",\"The house is in a great location to explore Chania. We were able to walk easily to the harbor and many restaurants. The house was clean, supplied all the necessities. Christina arranged transport from and to the airport and was at the house to greet us   <br/>She responded very quickly to our questions during our stay. There are a lot of stairs in the house so be aware of that. Everything is in perfect condition but the rooms are small. We enjoyed our stay very much!\",\"When we first checked in, we could not believe this was our rental. It was so modern and luxurious - four stories! Three bathrooms! A Private suite and terrace!! Plus you could not beat the location: we easily found parking after our day trips to the Western beaches and at night we walked short distances to restaurants and shops - plus there is an incredible beer bar two doors down (just look for the Chimay sign!). We only stayed for two nights but would have happily stayed several more!\",\"This place is incredible! Inside a historic building with a touch of modern. In the heart of old town. You’re literally in the middle of all of it. Additionally the beach is a short 5 minute walk. <br/>Christina made check in and out a breeze and if we had any questions she was there to help. <br/>The only negative thing I have to say is that I wished our stay was much longer. Next time we will be staying at least a week. <br/>We already miss Chania.\",\"Beautiful place, we enjoyed our time there\",\"A very nice place in a very good location\",\"We really enjoyed our stay at this recently-renovated building in the historic district of town. The space was tight but very well appointed with a full kitchen, dining area, living room and rooftop deck. The best feature of this unit is the perfect location. Tucked just a touch back from the harbor, with its myriad of dining options, sailing, postcard sunsets, and entertainment. Very walkable and easy in/out. Beds were comfortable and AC worked very well. There is a small grocery/bodega right around the corner with morning coffee and pastries. Evenings were quiet despite being near the entertainment district. We would recommend this place.\",\"The Neoria Houses in Chania were fantastic.  Could not have been more centrally located, and beautifully designed with a mix of old and new.  We were welcomed with warm hospitality and wonderful advice and offers of help.  We would go back anytime.\",\"Location is the best thing about this space! Quiet despite the bustling area. Very chic decor. Lovely space!! <br/>Beds, pillows, and top blankets could’ve been more comfortable. That’s the only downside!!\",\"Incredible location, space and views!  <br/>The only issue we had was finding the location upon check in- we rented a car and gps maps navigated us to the wrong spot with the address provided (it showed it across the street from the actual location).  Pro tip: gps navigate to “The Chop Street Food, Chania” and park in the tiny parking lot immediately following the The Chop- this is where our host met us and the best place to unload the vehicle.  Parking was extremely difficult to find nearby so we ended up parking a ways away and leaving there car there our entire stay lol.  <br/>Besides that, we absolutely loved everything about our stay!  10/10 recommended stay.\",\"Enjoyed our stay in Chania. Comfortable accommodations with parking nearby. Really can’t beat the location near the port / old town and everything you’ll want to see plus host provided list of recommended restaurants. Great home base for your time in Chania.\",\"Great location and beautiful home! The host was very accommodating and helpful. We walked easily to all of the parts of town we wanted to visit and were very comfortable.\",\"A wonderful apartment with a great private balcony. Very walkable.

the gemstone on the most priceless jewel of western Crete, called old town of Chania. It will amaze you whenever you visit it.The Venetian port of Chania, including the Venetian lighthouse, is one of the symbols of the city and a favorite walking area for locals and visitors alike.The lighthouse of Chania differs from others of its time and cannot be classified in any standard lighthouse category. The architecture reminds one of a minaret, and it does not include a lighthouse keeper sleeping quarters, given the fact that it is located in an inhabited area.The Venetian shipyards (Arsenali, in Italian) were used for the repairing of ships during the winter, in the years of the Venetian rule. The largest complex was built between 1526 and 1599 and it consisted of 17 vaulted constructions. The Moro arsenals (named after the governor or Provveditore Generale) were built in 1607. Only two of them survive entire today, while the third one collapsed during the bomb-raids of 1941.\"},{\"title\":\"Getting around\",\"value\":\"WALKING DISTANCES:Venetian Port: You are hereMunicipal parking:       500 meters awayPublic Market:                 6 minutesArcheological Museum: 10 minutesMaritime Museum:         10 minutesBeach Koum Kapi:           5 minutesPublic buses: www.e-ktel.com/en/We are at your disposal in order to help you to discover Chania: Taxi or transfer service, Excursions, Car rental service, etc.Central Bus Station:       10 minutesCentral Taxi Station:         5 minutes\"}]</td><td>[{\"title\":null,\"value\":\"This beautiful and newly renovated 2 bedroom house is situated in the heart of the old town of Chania, and a very short walk from the Venetian Harbor.

The fridge is pre-loaded with water and beers, at very reasonable prices, which is always appreciated. Location is great, very central and convenient, easy to walk everywhere around town. The apartment itself is inside the house, which means you'll open the front door and step in to their living room where the hosts family can sit and watch TV. The apartment is on the second level and it's \\\"private\\\" but like stated, you do walk through their house to get there, meaning not a private entrance. Yolanda is helpful and caring, in my opinion a little too caring and observing.. I felt watched and observed the little time I spent there. Also I was sat down in a rocking chair first thing checking in to be informed sternly about rules and regulations. In 20-30 rentals in Cuba I've never had that scrutiny in my visit, almost implying I'm there to engage in sex trade. Not very welcoming. Good place to stay and sleep though, but barely\",\"The appartment is a private floor in the house and very nice  and clean (hall, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and terrace!). You dont have your own entrance (from the street), however this is no problem.

Yolandas english is not very good, however she is very nice and helpfull and together we understood and everyting worked out great.\",\"Well located accommodation in Cienfuegos, with important places to see nearby. Yolanda was very kind, she told us all the places we could see and gave us all the help we needed for our stay.

Within a few minutes you can discover different sights. The Malecon is a 10-minute walk away. This place is recommended when the sun goes down. I highly recommend the Casa.

Everything was walkable to get too, we had a wonderful stay.\",\"Everything was incredible\",\"Casa Barco is located in a very walkable area. If you are taking the ferry or a water taxi to get to Cancun, this spot makes pick up and drop off super simple. It is loud because of the street noise. <br/>Pros:<br/>Great A/C<br/>Location is very walkable and near lots of amazing restaurants and the market <br/>Very friendly and kind staff<br/>Things to note:<br/>This is a hotel, not a house. There is a small fridge and coffee bar. <br/>It is loud because of the street noise.\",\"We stayed for one night only, everything was prefect\",\"We had a perfect stay at Casa Barco. Staff at both the hotel and restaurant below were friendly and helpful, and fixed a squeaky door when we asked. Good food and drink at the street level restaurant, along with live music in the afternoons, we passed many pleasant and relaxing hours there. Highly recommend.\",\"Nice room, good ocean view and very central location that was easily walkable to most things you would want to do.  Only complaint is that given what we paid for the room no towels were provided for use at their pool and no drinking glasses were provided in the room.  Small points but would have been a nice touch.\",\"Casa Barco has been one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at and I’ve frequented many. The unit is spotless, comfortable, and in an excellent location right near the Ferry and Go Cart Rentals. Book this place!\",\"The accommodation was nice, clean, overlooking the harbor,<br/>a short walk from the centre and to the North beach, where the sea is beautifully blue\",\"The suite, decor, location and excellent cleanliness.  No option to bill not digital chain, not stamped for sat (Mexico).\",\"Second time here. Great location that is clean with a great host. They actually have a maid service that cleaned everyday (so nice!). 5/5 would recommend. Only thing I would say is the fridge is small, so you cannot store much in there and definitely no ice.\",\"It was a good stay at Marina Bartolomé. we enjoyed our space and it was quite nice! good views of the sunset from our balcony. The room was clean, and cleaned by housekeeping staff frequently. Everyone was very friendly!<br/>the hotel is located right on the busy main vehicle street of Isla Mujeres, so the sound of cars can be heard often until about midnight. not too noisy, but I highly recommend a set of ear plugs!\",\"Great deal! Will be staying here again!\",\"Super nice hotel with perfect location. The associated restaurant was also super delicious. All the staff were friendly and helpful:) <br/>Thanks for the great stay!\",\"Very nice room and comfortable and well located and good price value. There is only no attention or pool towels or sometimes no one was there to pay attention\",\"Perfect. Will definitely return\",\"Awesome views! Great services, want to come back!\",\"We absolutely loved it here!  Located right by the ferry which is perfect and has ocean front views, amazing!  Short walk to dump your bags, and then explore the north end of the island.  We walked everywhere on the north end and rented a golf cart for 1 day to see the rest.  Bed was comfortable, clean, frig, microwave, coffee maker, all the things you need.  Only improvement I would say is to add luggage rack or something so you can put your luggage on.  We will always stay here when we come to Isla Mujeres!\",\"Clean modern hotel room! Loved our large balcony and view!\",\"Strategic location… meters from the port where the Ferry arrives and a few blocks from the main pedestrian where the bars and restaurants are.<br/>From the beach it will be about 5 or 6 blocks... but easy to walk.<br/>It also has the bus stop that takes you to Playa Sur a few meters away.<br/>What was a bit “loose” was the restaurant downstairs… I had read the positive reviews… and I went with a high expectation. We went for breakfast and the truth is that everything was very busy... gladly in relation to the price. We didn't really give it another chance.\",\"Looked exactly like in the photos! The view is amazing & the bed was super comfortable. Had everything we needed and we could even check-in earlier, which was very much appreciated! :) Amazing place to spend the night - I would definitely come back!!\",\"We had a lovely stay here at Casa Barco! Great location, great food in the restaurant below, great music, great views! Not to mention the host is wonderful and accommodating. It is super close to the ferry terminal which  made getting there a breeze. It’s a perfect spot to book if you’re a first timer to Isla Mujeres and want to take your time getting to know your way around :)\",\"Top location and suites are well equipped! Unique view and great host! The only drawback: The windows and doors insulate almost no noise and the suites are on a main traffic axis. For sensitive sleepers, that's nothing. It worked relatively well with earplugs. I also don't understand why it was no longer invested because the rest was really spotless! 3-fold glazed windows and a decent door don't cost too much these days. Too bad - that's a point deduction but I would book it again\",\"Had such an amazing stay here! Host was very helpful and responsive. Very clean and was so impressed with the beautiful views! Will be back!\",\"Spectacular! As in the photos. Super clean and beautiful overlooking the ocean.

In house activities like the pool table kept the whole group entertained for hours. Modern finishes throughout the house really tied the whole experience together.\",\"Place is good location with a great living space for a big group. We were a bit surprised to find out 5 days before our stay about the extra cost for bed linen ($20/pax) but to be honest it was stated in the description which obviously didn’t read in full. Otherwise the  place was great for the value.\",\"The house was lovely, with a fantastic location that made it easy to explore the area. However, the cleanliness didn't quite meet my standards—it was adequate but could have been better. Overall, a pleasant stay!\",\"This is the 2nd time we have stayed at Laurence's place. The location is fantastic and the house has everything you could need. It is modern, well set out and comfortable. Laurence is very responsive and a great host. We will definitely be back.\",\"We spent a phenomenal week here. The house was brilliant and the garage room with the pool table was well used. The proximity to the beach was also amazing\",\"Laurence was a fantastic host, very friendly and responsive. The house was a dream, had everything we needed. Only a few minutes walk to the beach and good coffee\",\"Had a fabulous stay with 3 families with young kids. Location was great next to the beach and cafe. Well set up for families with high chair and toys etc. Quick communication and easy check in. We had a great time thanks Laurence!\",\"An amazing holiday home for our multi generational family holiday. Absolutely everything we needed, and more. Laurence was so supportive and responsive, a genuinely great host. We definitely will book again.\",\"Such a beautiful house, proximity to the beach was great and the place was very spacious, highly recommend if sharing with a few families or with friends! Laurence was very accomodating, and made the stay very relaxing and easy going. We didn't really get to explore the area much, but it was a very quiet and peaceful area, we hope to come back, and would definitely stay at Laurences place again!\",\"Beautiful home and area. Laurence was extremely accommodating and responsive. Great bang for your buck\",\"We loved staying here last time and were very happy to come again!\",\"It was great location and great accomodation comfortable residence for our group. Very well provisioned.\",\"A comfortable family home, with enough space for the 5 of us. Unfortunately the weather wasn't great this weekend so didn't get much of a chance to walk the surrounds,  but it's a lovely peaceful location.\",\"If you're reading this and still weighing your options, book this place! You will not regret it, I guarantee it! <br/>Everything you need (+more) for a home away from home. <br/>Immaculately clean! <br/>Kitchen is very well stocked w high quality   appliances and utensils. <br/>Showers are hot with great pressure. <br/>Beds are comfortable. <br/>Pool table and ping pong for entertainment. <br/>Oceanview from the kitchen (we saw whales from the balcony!) <br/>Our 3 teenagers were well occupied and there's plenty of entertainment for kids and adults alike <br/>We paid extra for towels and linen but for 3 nights and such an incredible place, it was well worth it. <br/>Check-in was a breeze and Laurence was very responsive and helpful with suggestions around town.<br/>Restaurants and cafes were great! <br/>There is a woolwoorths and bws within 5 mins drive, many beaches in nearby Jervis bay for swimming as well as hiking trails. <br/>Highly highly recommended <br/>Thanks Laurence!\",\"We recently stayed with three families—6 adults and 6 kids—and had an amazing time. The house was spacious and well-equipped, with every kitchen tool imaginable, making it feel like a real home away from home. We loved the big dining table where we could all eat together, and the pantry essentials (tea/coffee/condiments) meant we could settle in straight away. The garden, pool table, and table tennis were a hit for both kids and adults. The beach was a short walk away, but we preferred the nearby lake for swimming since the ocean was quite rough during our stay. The house was comfortable, with plenty of space to relax, and the hosts provided thoughtful touches with books, toys, excess toiletries and laundry essentials. It was great value for money, and we’d love to come back again. A few more bins in the rooms & for recycling would have been helpful, but overall, it was the perfect spot for a fun family getaway. Great communication and check in from Laurence made us feel very welcome.\",\"We stayed at Lawrence’s place for my 20th birthday weekend and the house was amazing upon arrival, there was lots to do in the house and around the area.

Julie’s probably the most considerate and hospitable host we have ever had the pleasure to stay with! We had the best time!\",\"Julie’s Airbnb is a 10/10 spot, it’s very clean yet cozy, surrounded by beautiful views and extremely friendly cows! It was a very easy booking process and check in. Everytime we needed help with something she was there to hand straight away. The location is very convenient, very short travels to countless beautiful beach towns and plenty to do ( even with the heavy rain we had lol). Julie provides a substantial amount of snacks, goodies and light breakfast foods which was lovely, also plenty of hot and cold drinks to hand. <br/>We both loved are stay here and would like to return one day! <br/>Many thanks David and Ceri\",\"Our stay was the perfect weekend away to relax and unwind. The directions Julie provided were easy to follow and we had no trouble finding the property. Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly face which made us feel right at home. The property itself was spotless, we couldn’t fault it. There was a huge selection of food and drink options in the room, something for everyone! Julie also provided a large range of toiletries and anything else you may have forgotten to pack. Julie has considered absolutely everything guests may need on their stay. <br/>Thank you so much for a lovely weekend. We would love to stay at the property again in the future :)\",\"We stayed for a week in Julie's clean and comfortable annex, there is no kitchen but the very generous supply of drinks and snacks provided was helpful. The view from the room is panoramic with fields of grazing cows and  countryside beyond, it really is a special spot. Generally the location is pretty perfect for exploring the stunning Ceredigion  coast with its coastal paths and sandy beaches. <br/>Thanks for a great holiday Julie !\",\"Had a feeling that Julie’s place was going to tick our boxes and it exceeded expectations!!  We needed a private bolt hole and somewhere to just exist for a few days and it was perfect!  Quiet, well stocked, perfect sunsets, clean and a field full of cows!  What more could you wish for!  Thank you Julie! \uD83D\uDE0A\",\"Julie was a great host. Came to greet us and left lots of info and left us alone which is exactly how we like it. She left LOADS of breakfast supplies and drinks ect in the room. She even left two little bunny eggs as we stayed over Easter. Lots of toiletries she really thought of everything and left it for us. The place was beautiful, spotless clean and all modern and fresh. The view well, it was amazing!! We wanted a place out of the way to relax but close enough todo things if we wanted, the place is so nice it's hard to leave. A lovely place to recharge the batteries!\",\"Julie is the most welcoming host I have come across and also has the best Air bnb I have used. Julie’s place was beautiful, extremely clean and fully stocked with everything you could need! The views were beautiful and the linens and towels smelt amazing! Julie was there to welcome us and told us to let her know if we needed anything, which we didn’t as everything was already provided! Julie also provided recommendations for the area which we used and we had delicious meals! We also loved seeing the curious cows as we came into the lane! Thanks again for hosting us in your beautiful home!\",\"Everything exceeded our expectations from the moment we arrived to when we had to leave. Julie had thought of everything and I mean absolutely everything! Generously stocked cupboards with food items for breakfast and snacks, milk, bread, butter, cereal, drinks, water, tea, coffee etc etc. the bathroom was also fully stocked and immaculate.<br/>The views were breathtaking & the cows became our best friends. <br/>Highly recommend, you won’t be disappointed\",\"This is a beautiful, well presented modern little property. With views over the Welsh countryside it is quiet and peaceful.  I only became aware there was no kitchen facilities after I booked it but Julie provides everything for hot drinks and a cereal inspired breakfast. The lack of a kitchen is reflected in the price but it would be helpful if it was stated more clearly in the text.\",\"I had an incredible stay! The place was spotless, beautifully decorated, and had all the amenities I needed. The host was incredibly responsive and helpful, making sure everything was perfect. The location was ideal, very very peaceful. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others! Many thanks, Tom\",\"One of the most amazing stays we’ve ever had! An absolutely wonderful host, the place was immaculate and the location was incredible. The fridge was stocked with delicious goodies and plenty of snacks available too! It felt like Julie had thought of absolutely everything you may need for your stay. <br/>Apart from the cows being the superstars of the whole stay we got to meet the lovely farmers too who told us all about their cattle. Everyone was so friendly and made us feel right at home!<br/>The location is perfect if you’re looking to enjoy peace and quiet but also want to explore. There are some really amazing walks and adventures (plenty of ideas provided by Julie, a whole folder you can choose from for ideas in the area!).<br/>Overall it was the best few days, exactly what we were looking for and honestly hope to come back someday. Highly, highly recommend!!\",\"We absolutely loved staying at this Airbnb. The attention to detail and thought at this place is impeccable. Everything you could want for breakfast, a stash of toiletries for anything you’ve forgotten and items to take to the beach too! The country setting is beautiful and made for a relaxing getaway. Julie’s recommendations for places to eat and things go in the local area were also amazing.  Would highly recommend this place!\",\"We stayed here for three nights and must say it's one our best experiences.

When we walked in there were lots of recommendations for us to do locally. The place was lovely and we had so much food we didn’t know what to do with it all! If i was to visit this area again, i’d definitely stay here again.\",\"We had a wonderful stay at Julies's place.<br/>Probably the best Airbnb we've ever done !<br/>The place is very quiet, spacious with a very nice view and very clean.<br/>There is everything you need to eat and more  for breakfast.<br/>Julie is an amazing host.<br/>It really deserves more than 5 stars !\",\"We had a wonderful stay at Julie's place! Julie was a wonderful host who prepared the place with a lot of love and immediately made us feel welcome. The AirBnB is perfect for relaxing days, during the day you can make nice excursions to beaches nearby and in the evening enjoy the quiet atmosphere around the accommodation. We highly recommend the place and hope to come again!\",\"What an amazing find......will be returning at the end of the summer!!<br/>Soooo peaceful & private a total escape!!<br/>Julie had thought of everything, extremely generous with breakfast supplies & toiletries.<br/>Perfectly placed to explore the coast or the countryside.<br/>The cows in the field were hilariousously inquisitive and tame!! And watching the swallows was a delight!!<br/>Thank you Julie it was such a wonderful stay.....if you are looking to unwind this is the place to be!! Xx\",\"We absolutely loved staying at Julie’s air b&b. It was so clean and stocked full with everything we could need. It was so clean and the bed was super comfortable.

Lovely place was super clean and plenty of amenities. The cows were super cute and we hope to come back!\",\"We enjoyed our stay from the first second. The place was super equipped, modern and cozy and the ingredients for breakfast were more than plentiful. <br/>We felt very welcome at Julie's place and would love to come back \uD83D\uDE0A\",\"Absolutely perfect second stay!<br/>We loved everything about our stay, it was quiet and really relaxing. The stay is extremely private with your own entrance so you can come and go as you please. The rooms were spotless and had everything you could possibly need and so much more! <br/>Julie is super friendly and helpful and always at hand if you should ever need anything. <br/>We got to share our stay with the cows this time too! they are super curious and love coming over to say hello! with the added bonus that they are really quiet so no worries about any noise.<br/>I honestly can't reccomended this place enough!\",\"This lovely annexe is a gem in the countryside.  Such a peaceful location yet only a short drive from the coast.  There were also opportunities to take walks direct from the property.  Julie had thought of everything to ensure a stress-free visit.  There is no kitchen in the property but the array of breakfast goodies plus fruit and snacks together with a kettle and toaster ensured we were well served.  Lots of great places to eat locally but please be sure to book as the best can be busy.  Our only disappointment was we had to leave. Definitely on our list of favourites.\",\"Julie went above and beyond to make our stay very enjoyable. The cupboards had everything we needed and more, she thought of every single detail.<br/>Lovely person and made  us feel very welcome. It was great view from our patio doors and we looked onto fields full of cows.<br/>Great base to come back to after visiting all the local beaches, which were beautiful.<br/>Would 100% recommend and will definitely visit again.Thank you Julie. x\"]</td><td>4.96</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"401996961\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/401996961\"}</td><td>Newcastle Emlyn, Ceredigion, United

Place is really beautifull. If I would say something negative about the place it would be that fridge is fairly small for 3 people and host didn't provide us with garbage stamps, which you have to buy in bulk of around 10 for 33 franks. We needed one. Over all, I would stay again.\",\"We had a great time in Waldenburg. The town is very nice and from the terrace upstairs you can even see the ruin of Waldenburg. The house is large and very clean. Cozy furnishings. It has everything you need. Annegret and her husband are very nice and good hosts! Check in and out with key box very straightforward. Glad to come back!\",\"The location is perfect for anyone who enjoys nature and trekking! The property is cleaned and spacious and ideal for families with children! <br/>Brilliant friendly host!\",\"Very nice house with garden. Very nice to unwind or to start day trips in all directions. Glad to come back!\",\"A very nice house, super located (beautiful landscape, several restaurants to reach on foot in a few minutes; the nearest supermarket but only in about 2 km). Still very quiet at night. Lots of privacy through the private entrance, beautiful garden, hiking trails just around the corner (however, all paths except in the village are hilly, possibly not suitable for people with walker etc.). The house (kitchen, laundry room, barbecue area, etc. ) is perfectly equipped, even for a long stay. There was enough space for 5 people plus a baby. We definitely recommend the house!\",\"We had a great family vacation and were able to enjoy the swimming pool in the village very much. It was the hit for us!  Super stylish place.\",\"A secret tip for nature lovers<br/>After a personal introduction by the host, who also showed us the first sights on the way from the train station, we were able to experience adventurous and relaxing holidays in the beautiful old house. The furnishings are basic but very chosen. All furniture is harmoniously selected and fit perfectly into the house with their clear design style and robust character. The kitchen offers everything your heart desires. Since the kitchen herbs grow right at your doorstep, supplies are also automatically provided here. <br/>During the day we enjoyed the many hiking trails around Waldenburg, whereby we especially liked the small ponds under the dragon hole. This is where we also found Ammonites and other estuaries.<br/>The large terrace behind the house offers a cool, windless spot, where you can enjoy the view of Waldenburg Castle to the last ray of the sun. With a delicacy, prepared on the large wooden grill and a glass of wine, every evening is a successful end to the day.\",\"Really nice house.

Nice place to stay if you are a kite surfer or need a place to crash close to the local airport.\",\"An amazing house, host and town. You get exactly what you are offered and more. I Highly recommend this accommodation not only for kiting but a fantastic Calabrian experience.\",\"Massimo is the best Host one could ask for. He is very kind, considerate and enthusiastic. He fed us with melon and coffee and showed us how to kite surf. The apartment is very spacious and clean with a nice balcony and terrace.

Unfortunately it had stains on the linen and carpet and sticky stuff on the carpet in the bedroom. The place was not clean. The host only sent out standard responses  which seemed to have been pre prepared but did not communicate to answer any questions asked or otherwise communicate\",\"Perfect location and a spacious apartment. The instructions for key collection were clear and easy to follow. However, given the high cleaning fee it was disappointing the apartment had evidently not been cleaned to a high standard before our arrival. There were hand marks across the mirrors, no drinking glasses, heavy dust in the bedroom on blinds and shelves, noticeable mould around the bath / shower.\",\"Wonderful central location and photos gave very clear instructions on how to find the apartment. Bedroom was spacious and a super comfy bed. Living area large and great to spend time in. Really handy having fans in both the bedroom and living room - very much appreciated on a hot summer afternoon! Beautiful apartment that I very much looked forward to coming back at the end of the day!\",\"Highly recommend this flat if you’re looking for a stay in Brighton! It’s in the prime spot, minutes walk to the beach & The Lanes- couldn’t have got a better location!! It’s perfect if you want to be in the hustle and bustle of the shops, restaurants etc however not overly noisy.<br/>Perfect for myself, boyfriend and two small dogs. Even though it is dog friendly, it was still really clean- so if you’re petless don’t worry it doesn’t smell like dog etc. <br/>The flat was clean & tidy, exactly as described. It’s modern and spacious, great for a few nights stay. The living area was really reasonable, with a smart TV and lovely warm cosy lighting. Very homely once settled in. The bathroom was modern and sleek, clean but did have a little mould in the shower (but I’d say this is to be expected and wasn’t awful). <br/>The instructions to find & check in were so clear, was very impressed! The flat is accessible but felt safe/secure, despite being bang in the centre of town.\",\"We had a great weekend in Brighton and really enjoyed our stay here\",\"A really beautiful flat in a perfect location. We were walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go. The hosts were really responsive and helpful with every question I had.<br/>The sofa bed was a little odd in that the pull out was not the same height as the rest of the sofa and it was a bit small for one person to just lie on the pull out. Other than that, the flat was great.<br/>My friends and I would all definitely stay again.\",\"Location was very central to everything and access was easy. The apartment itself should’ve been cleaned better before new occupants - for a cleaning fee you’d expect it to be clean. <br/>Overall, it was okay. It was conveniently located to most attractions, but please make sure the cleaning company actually cleans. It is spacious too which is a plus.\",\"Spacious, tastefully furnished and spotlessly clean flat in the centre of town. We were concerned that it might be noisy at night, but we had no issues and had a good rest. The check-in process was unusual but easy to follow. The heating did not work in the lounge, and though we were told someone was going to fix it did not happen. We would stay again, given the heating gets fixed.\",\"Lovely and clean apartment in the center of Brighton with spacious and well-furnished rooms. Perfect location for walking to the beach, shops, pubs, and landmarks. Highly recommended.\",\"The place is amazing!<br/>I felt like home. It’s near all needed shops, groceries and even the mall. There’s even a 24/7 store open, so it is very convenient.<br/>There were a few concerns that I had but the over all experience was great and the host is very responsive.<br/>Will definitely book this place the next time I get a chance.<br/>Thank you!\",\"What a great location! Right in the middle of Brighton, just a two minute walk from Churchill Orange carpark. Absolutely perfect for our stay. The apartment is nice and big, very clean and has everything you need.<br/>Check in and key collection was nice and easy, be aware that Costa no longer exists though but you should be able to find it with the instructions.<br/>One suggestion would be blackout blinds in the bedroom as it was like sleeping with the lights on due to all the highly lit shops right outside. Other than this, we would definitely look to return due to the amazing location.\",\"Great stay! First of all, perfect location! close to the beach and all the fun pubs. Basic and clean appartment, all things necessary are available. Fast en nice communication with the host. Would recommend!\",\"We were looking for a central place and as Luke had told us it was.<br/>The sound insulation quality of the apartment allowed us to live there in a high quality silence despite the outside traffic.<br/>Proximity to sea is also a highlight.<br/>We highly recommend this rental to any guest wishing to discover this seaside resort in optimal conditions.\",\"Great location!\",\"Luke was very helpful in providing clear instructions for both check in and check out and the place was lovely. Large and spotless, great location and not noisy at night! I would definitely stay there again!\",\"Our stay itself in the flat was perfect, great location, and more than enough space for 4 people. The only complain is that the host was not very responsive to my messages when i had some questions before the trip.\",\"Amazing stay at Luke’s for my birthday! So central and everything just a stone throw away! Perfect for just a chill night too and staying in to cook dinner. Would definitely return!!\",\"Great little spot central located with good modern furniture. The only negative aspect was that traffic noise and construction within the building made sleeping past 6 am very difficult.\",\"4 of us stayed here for the night and were so pleased with the super convenient location. We just had to step outside to get to restaurants, bars and shops.<br/>Everything in the apartment was clean, modern, and comfortable.<br/>Would absolutely stay there again!\",\"Jake and staff were just amazing! Good communication and the apartment is stunning. The only thing that could be improved would be to have an extra fan in the room so it wouldn't be so stuffy. Thank you so much for the lovely weekend in Brighton :)\",\"Very good stay despite the work on the street until midnight and in the apartment above during the day. Central placement. Just missing glasses ... (there are only 2 glasses on foot)\",\"Lovely flat with a central location. Communication with the hosts was prompt and smooth. Easy check-in. Very clean and well-equipped apartment.\",\"The flat is centrally located and quite spacious. Overall, our stay was pleasant, but communication with the hosts was somewhat challenging. We provided feedback that the third bed we had booked was not made, and we had to search for the bedding (which was found under the couch), in addition to the malfunctioning heating system. Unfortunately, there was no response regarding the third bed, and despite our observation that the heating was not functioning while we were in the flat, the hosts insisted that it was working. Additionally, please note that the Costa Coffee mentioned in their instructions for locating the flat no longer exists, so don't get confused when you are looking for it.\",\"Great location however was disappointed. The cleaner didn’t drop the keys off on time so we had to wait 45mins past our check in time - this wasn’t great as chucking down with rain and we had lots of bags. The heating was broken in the living room so very cold - I had a poor night’s sleep  on the sofa bed and v cold in the morning . A shame there weren’t any batteries in the remote control as the tv couldn’t be accessed manually so wasn’t able to use . A guide to the house would’ve been helpful eg you need to go into the cleaning cupboard to turn on the towel rail on in the bathroom & the touch screen heater in the bedroom-we had to message quite a few times to work stuff out,which was irritating. However we did get an immediate response .\"]</td><td>4.62</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"397887251\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/397887251\"}</td><td>Brighton and Hove, England, United

The main attraction is that it is the only lodging option in São Roque de Minas that is closest to the Serra da Canastra National Park - it is 4 km from the entrance and in the park a few kilometers away is the source of the São Francisco River, a region much visited by tourists and mountaineers who want to venture out and enjoy nature!The spaceAfter 25 years of exploring only the camping area, Chalé da Picareta was built to offer greater comfort to tourists and mountain adventurers. It is an excellent accommodation for families and groups of up to 4 people, in a quiet and cozy environment. It's not an inn, what we offer is an immersive experience at the ranch! You'll love connecting with the rhythm of the mountain. Masonry chalet, with a large balcony and mountain view. The large bedroom has a double bed and two single beds, with a flat-screen TV and air-conditioning. Full kitchen with microwave, stove, refrigerator and complete utensils. Full bathroom with electric shower. The story of the Picareta farm:In 1967, when Chico Chagas and Dona Teresinha bought the farm, they discovered a pickaxe stuck in the stone. This pickaxe dates back to the slave era when they explored the region with dynamites, pickaxes and other tools. Tourists try to remove it every year, but to no avail. Thus, this historic object gave its name to the Picareta farm. Another landmark of the place that highlights the time of slavery in the region are the stone walls that the farm still has today. As sad as this past is, it is true and its traces can be observed and studied by those who visit the region to help us understand human deeds.Guest accessThe chalet's access is totally privateParking next to the chalet Access to trails and waterfalls within the farm Access to the stream that runs the full length of the farmOther things to noteIn front of the bedroom window is a pergola that houses a hammock for relaxing. There is a stream that runs the length of the entire farm and a beautiful trail along its banks.We will be happy to give tips on hiking and tours in the region. In the central house of the farm, there is always a piece of Serra da Canastra cheese, sassafras cachaça and fresh coffee available as courtesy gifts from the Chagas family.</td><td>Stays</td><td>true</td><td>null</td><td>[\"The picareta cottage is perfect \uD83D\uDC96 <br/>It is close to the Serra da Canastra National Park.<br/>Everything I needed was in the cottage.<br/>Everything was new.<br/>peaceful and quiet place.<br/>Dona Terezinha and her Chico are very attentive.<br/>There are mango trees.<br/>And a clean river for bathing on the property <br/>I wanted to live there.

Luciane and her relatives are all very cordial and helpful. They helped us with everything we needed, there was still cake and cheese when we arrived at the cottage. The cottage fully consistent with the photos. We highly recommend it!!!\",\"Sensational!<br/>The place is a wonderful place and next to Canastra Park. <br/>The cleaning of the chalet is impeccable and everything is very complete and well arranged. <br/>Mr. Chico and his family are great people, very friendly and good hosts. <br/>It's a place to keep in our hearts. <br/>Thank you so much for everything!\",\"Everything was great. The description and photos perfectly match what the cottage and surroundings offer. We spent a few days in direct contact with the rustic and beautiful nature of the place and at the same time pampered by the comfort that the chalet offers. Complete privacy. It has everything we need. Luciane and Darcio were always efficient, super kind and generous. We will miss it and hope to return one day.\",\"Very good stay, the hosts were very responsive and the cottage is a cutie, well located near entrance 2.\",\"I had a great conversation with the owner, I found the place easily after she sent me the location. The place is beautiful, breathtaking view and a silence and connection with the unspeakable nature. It was easy to find, and an ordinary car can get there quietly. I was very well received and I was lucky to have contact with amazing animals such as dogs, horses, otter and others. The city is close and the house is very comfortable, clean and tidy. The kitchen has everything I needed to make breakfast and dinner. I highly recommend it and will be back more often.\",\"From the time the host was confirmed, the host responded quickly and gave all the information about the location. The place itself is well organized, contains the necessary items to spend small and large periods of stays. The owners of the place are very helpful, the surrounding landscape is lush, since it is located near the road that gives access to the entrance to the upper part of the park, finally the owners of the place were very helpful and knowledgeable in the region.

Our stay was peaceful and very fruitful. The chalet is on a farm that has a river in the background, the waters are crystal clear  and quiet, they form several wells and natural pools. We had amazing days in this place, as the chalet is very close to the Serra da Canastra Park and it was possible to visit the top of Casca D'Danta in addition to the waterfalls of the Capão Forro Complex.  For those who wish to disconnect from the busy life, the cottage is the place! The owner Luciana is very polite and always responds to messages very carefully. We were greeted with a splendid cornmeal cake, cheeses, and pastries. Mr Chico, who welcomed us, is very friendly and polite!

Excellent experience!\",\"This is a special place.<br/>We often look for tours in search of adventure, trails with different levels of difficulty, incredible visuals with waterfalls, native forest, contact with nature in the purest and most genuine way, the surroundings of the Chalet has all this, with trails inside the farm space and good indications of attractions and tours in the city. <br/>The location is great and makes it easy to access several Serra waterfalls, downtown markets and restaurants.<br/>The Chalet is wonderful, everything is very clean and organized, with all the necessary utensils in the kitchen for longer stays, ample space that accommodates well 4 people with all the care of those who like to receive and treat their visits well.<br/>The warm welcome from the hosts, with pampering left in the fridge and the constant invitation to a coffee, piece of cheese, and good prose, make days better and less busy.<br/>And that's the main point, the place is beautiful and everything emanates peace, quiet and quiet. <br/>We'll be back soon!\",\"Great the Chalet, wonderful place, lush nature.<br/>Kind and solicitous homeowners.<br/>I recommend it.\",\"Our stay was amazing! The place is very beautiful, clean and the host was very helpful and helpful, helped us with everything we need! There is a camping in the area, but the chalet gives us a lot of privacy, we don't hear any noise beyond the river that passes through the property. Overall a beautiful place is well worth it I want to go back \uD83E\uDD70\",\"We love our Chalet Hosting. The host was very considerate and we felt very welcome. Among our hosting through the Serra da Canastra was undoubtedly the most comfortable. The chalet is quite spacious, very well equipped, with everything new and organized. Special highlight about the cleanliness that was spotless.<br/>The chalet is inside a property where there is a camping,  it is quite wide and has a no loud sound permission policy that is followed and well managed. We didn't have any noise issues even though we stayed for a holiday.<br/>The location is excellent, close to the National Park, gave us the way to some tours and for us (who were looking for peace and quiet) it was great not to be in the city. <br/>We would definitely return.\",\"Wonderful place, super clean, full chalet and breathtaking view! The owners were super considerate kind and treated us very well!!!

I pulled over on 80 as I was heading towards Rocky Springs and found it so easily and was able to communicate with Brayden in super fast response time. It is open concept upstairs and a well stocked kitchen with a big fridge/freezer. There was another guest there the first night who was super quiet and friendly. Brayden's home is sequestered in a nice quiet safe neighborhood and for the next 2 days had the place to myself! Wow...it was perfect for seeing clients remotely, making food, and even watched TV on the big screen one night. There is a washing machine and dryer and well...it's just a great place and would definitely return. And there is a great family style restaurant called Marty's nearby that had a great salad and lasagna and the portions are huge! Rock on Rocky Springs and bravo Brayden!\",\"My stay was super! Brayden is very good at communicating. I am certain that this was the best place I could have chosen. Great neighborhood, plenty of space along with amenities in each individual room.

Surely a recommendation for staying in Zadar.\",\"Superb ! A comfortable pristine apartment in a wonderful location .\",\"Fabulous stylish apartment,  great location on the edge of a small park just around the corner from the harbour and a short walk to the  footbridge that crosses over  to the old town of Zadar. Kitchen well equipped but to be honest we only boiled eggs and the kettle and ate out in the excellent restaurants mostly recommended in the booklet at the apartment;  which is well written and gives hints and tips about the accommodation and local amenities.  Safe, free parking just outside the premises with no issues getting a space. As a daily runner much appreciated the large shower with super high water pressure  and with plenty of hot water and the 15 min. sports programme on the washing machine was a bonus!  We stayed six nights and were given plenty of towels and the offer to have bedding changed on request. We found a bike hire place (helmet & locks) on the edge of the park outside  with really decent bikes (Cube) and cycled the coastal path to Plaza Rt Puntamika, Petrcane and Plaza Punta Skala stopping for a swim at each. We also took the opportunity to take the bikes on the ferry from Gazenica, Zadar to Preko on the island of Uglijan (you can’t take bikes on the nearby ferries as they are for foot passengers only), lovely place to explore by bike and plenty of good spots for a swim. I think there were 3 apartments, in the building, they are well sound insulated , never heard a sound or footstep! We did pick up breakfast from Farma&rawfood (near the bridge our side) which offered excellent smoothies and chia breakfast and chocolate pots.  What a great holiday, location and apartment, highly recommend.\",\"Superbly decorated apartment with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Highly recommend to everyone.\",\"Amazing flat.

Everything we needed was close by and there is so much to do and see that we decided to come back. <br/>Kim and Jakob were wonderful hosts and I can not say enough good things about our entire experience there.\",\"We have very comfortable living feelings\",\"The apartment was very nice in a modernly converted old farmhouse. Everything very comfortable and well equipped. The highlight is the good room with the wonderful tiled stove. Everything very comfortable. Rooms on two floors and a double room as a connecting room. Nine people with one bathroom is of course a challenge, but the second bathroom is under construction.\uD83D\uDE0A We were all very satisfied and will be happy to come back anytime. Thanks Kim and Jakob\",\"Amazing location for great mountain walks, cycling and day trips to Lake Constance. Kids lived the swings and trampoline.\",\"Kim and Jakob's place was beautiful. The garden with a small playground is great for the kids and the grill was prepared with everything you need by the hosts. The location is great for hiking or a short trip to Lake Constance.\",\"We spent a week skiing in Mellau with the whole family at the end of February. We greatly enjoyed Kim and Jacob's stay. Very friendly people with a warm welcome and a stay with all the comforts. Thank you for a good time.\",\"The place was really lovely! We were there with the whole family. We were particularly impressed by the breathtaking views. Kim and Jakob were incredibly helpful and supported us with all our concerns. The only little thing we missed was a second bathroom (which according to Kim and Jakob is still in the planning stage :-) ) and the ceilings could be a little higher – but that's just nitpicking. Overall it was a very nice, very clean and pleasant experience. We will be happy to come back!\",\"We had a great friends weekend at Kim and Jakob's place.

For children it is a paradise: playground in the garden, animals in the neighborhood (cows, goats, chickens,...) and enough space in the apartment. There is a small refrigerator with cheese, eggs and beer. With the guest card, many attractions can be used free of charge (e.g. the cable car in Bezau). We would recommend the place.\",\"We were two families, eight people and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The house is beautifully located in the middle of the mountains of the Bregenz Forest. <br/>Kim and Jakob have freshly laid eggs and other treats in an SB refrigerator. Milk and meat can be purchased from neighboring farms.<br/>We will be happy to come back!\",\"Really nice spot, close to Mellau/Damüls slopes!\",\"We were there as a group. 6 adults, 2 children, 2 infants and were very warmly received. Check-in and check-out was totally relaxed. Communication was very nice and everything was taken care of. Children's high chairs, cots, baths, plenty of toys in the sandbox, tricycle, swing, slide and and and. The children were allowed to feed the hens and play Frisbee in the adjoining field. The fact that it was already loud with us in the morning was not a problem at all. The location of the house was wonderful, we could go hiking directly and there was a lot to see for adults and children. In the center of Schwarzenberg is a well-equipped supermarket and a cafe with extremely good coffee and delicious cakes. Even in bad weather everything was very relaxed. In the house entrance space for shoes, umbrellas and fitted strollers, in the apartment a tile stove (which we did not use at all because we were constantly distracted) and games. A large dining table made sure that we first stayed as a group with children and then as a group among adult friends. Farm eggs, local cheese and milk, homemade syrup and herbal salt were for sale in the house entrance. We were happy and grateful to use it. Parking was right at the house, the kitchen well equipped, the bathroom super clean and comfortable.

The pool has a beautiful view and a really nice pool house. On top of that, Sylvain is really nice, and the communication was smooth. We enjoyed it a lot, and cannot recommend it enough. I hope we can come back next year !\",\"We’ve had a wonderful time in Rousson. The whole house was great. Superb balcony with magnificent view. A very cozy kitchen and nice living room. We especially liked the big entrances to the balcony both from kitchen and living room. The outside of the house was also splendid. The swimming pool with colorful light and the surrounding. The terrace in front of the swimming pool with couch and grill was great.<br/>The village is well located. Not far to all the famous towns and Camargue region.<br/>The only thing that we missed was air conditioning. Although we read before renting the house there’s no AC we spotted there are many air conditioners outside the house. They probably serve for the ground floor where the owners dwell or the AC will be available in the future. So if you look for it firstly ensure yourself by contacting with the owner.<br/>We were also a little bit worried about the deposit which was quite a huge. Perhaps it’s a standard custom in France. I didn’t check it before booking. However everything was fine and we got our money back the day we were leaving.<br/>So I can surely tell that Sylvian is a very nice and helpful host. He almost immediately reply to all our questions via the Airbnb messages. So make a booking and don’t worry at all \uD83E\uDD29\",\"Beautiful villa in a very quiet place.\",\"A real favorite for this sumptuous villa:)<br/>Sylvain's home shines with its cleanliness and complete equipment, both inside and in the pool area. In addition, its location is conveniently located for various activities.<br/>We received a warm welcome from Anne-Laure, who constantly took care of our well-being. Not only was she still available, but she also showed great proactivity throughout our stay.<br/>We were a group of eight people, and the property has plenty of space for everyone to enjoy their own living area.<br/>This place to stay, along with its host, has greatly contributed to the success of our holiday. I would recommend this place without hesitation.\",\"We had a great holiday in Sylvain's house, with our 2 teenagers and 2 children. The house is large and pleasant to live in, with a large balcony that gives a very nice view of the Cevennes hills. The pool with its fully equipped pool house, plancha, and ping pong table quickly became  the main living space:)! <br/>30 minutes around the house you can find any type of outings. Among them we particularly recommend riverside ginguettes in exceptional environments, the bamboo garden of Anduze as well as beautiful, and walks or jogging in the hills directly accessible from the house. <br/>We thank Sylvain for her kindness, discretion and availability to ensure our comfort.\",\"We had a pleasant pleasant stay in Villa de Sylvain, mainly in and around the pretty  pool and pool house (very equipped).<br/>Our host, Sylvain, was  discreet and attentive.<br/>We recommend it!\",\"We had a great time staying at Sylvain's house, booking without hesitation:)\",\"Welcoming and warm villa!<br/>Perfect for organizing your vacation with friends, there are many common areas available. In this wonderful weather we had access to the mountainous setting offered by the Plateau du Rousson. Hosts are respectful of privacy and are open to discussion. We have some really good memories! <br/>Margot & Angelo.\",\"A beautiful week of vacation, ideal with our 4 teenagers, the house is well equipped, the pool house and the living room, are equipment (wc, fridge, plancha, dishwasher) makes it functional, we took all our meals at this place. The host who lives in the basement of the house is more than discreet. Outdoor lighting is a  real plus to spend a beautiful evening around the pool. I would recommend it 100%.\",\"Sylvain's property is just beautiful!! We had a memorable stay!!!!<br/> Nothing is missing: the pool house is super equipped , Breakfasts and meals  by the pool,   just topsize!!!  Pool  size ideal, <br/>Same for the house which is very spacious, large bathroom, huge terrace with breathtaking views and  ideally located to discover the Cevennes , the  Gard , the Ardeche......<br/>Sylvain takes great care of his guests , he is  very discreet and available.<br/> Book with your eyes closed, you'll be delighted!!!!\",\"Superb spacious and clean villa, very nice view, beautiful moments around the beautiful pool and its fully equipped pool house. There's nothing there here, hosts available and discreet. <br/>We recommend.\",\"Very beautiful house with many services. Nice view, quiet guaranteed.

However, breakfast was excellent (made by Abdulla’s mother) and the host is very kind and full of advice. Would recommend for a short stay.\",\"Staying at Abdulla's guesthouse was a wonderful period. He is very nice and a great host! After I showed him the activities I wanted to complete he helped organized and communicated with relevant agents to ensure a great experience. The breakfast was lovely and the staff was lovely. The location was perfect for my needs, I highly recommend his hotel to future guests!\",\"Great location, good value for money, would recommend for anyone looking for home from home\",\"Abdulla is a perfect host - very positive and helpful beyond our expectations. He helped us to find best diving centre in Nungwi, he recommended good restaurants and helped us with transport. We think, that he knows everyone in Nungwi ;)\\r<br/>His place is superclean, quiet and very relaxing. Super comfy bed, awesome bathroom. 5 minutes walk to small beach near turtles aquarium, 20 minutes walk to centre of village and more \\\"touristic\\\" area.\",\"Abdulla is a great host - very friendly, nice and helpful. Me and my friends had a great time there. And we loved the shower! Hot water and high water pressure is not that common on Zanzibar. The location is also great - only 5 minutes from the beach. If you are planning on staying in Nungwi I highly recommend Mwana house!\",\"Abdulla made me feel really welcome. Like others previous guests had mentioned he knows everyone and can help you save when it comes to excursions around Zanzibar. Rooms are spacious,clean  and you can have hot shower too. You can swim next with the sea turtles next door. Beach is only 2 min walk. I came to Zanzibar alone and made lots of friends through Abdulla. I really enjoyed my stay at mwana house. Thank you:)\",\"Abdulla's place was a short walk to the beach and thankfully tucked away from all the tourists resorts. Breakfast was simple, yet yummy and filling. Abdulla was easy to communicate with and always cheerful. He was super helpful and even arranged transportation from Stonetown to Nungwi.  (ask for the driver Omary who has great prices!) Thanks again, Abdulla!\",\"Abdulla was the perfect host. He made us feel welcome and at home, very obliging and helpful with lots of assistance and advice pertaining to restaurants and things to do that we really appreciated. He saved us quite a bit of money through his connections for a snorkelling trip which was awesome. He was very respectful and never over bearing. Even the cleaning lady Thumu was warm and welcoming. The establishment is rustic but well kept, neat and clean and very homely. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Mwana house. Asante sana Abdulla. :)\",\"Very good quality for the amount you pay: close to the beach, small shops just opposite the guesthouse. Abdulla was very welcoming and helpful. If you want to stay in a busy tourist area but still feel at home - this is your #1 choice! Thank you, Abdulla and hope to see you again!\",\"A nice room in a good guesthouse. Everything is clean and proper. Great place 3-5 minutes from the beach. Very close to local shops. \\r<br/>Abdulla was really nice and friendly, always tried to help me.  I really enjoyed my time here! I would highly recommend staying  at Mwana House.\\r<br/>\",\"We had a really nice stay at Mwana House. Abdulla was very friendly and helpful host. The place is located in quieter part of Nungwi with few restaurants around, couple of minutes from the local beach. Wish we could stay longer. I would definitely recommend it.\",\"Mwana house lives up to it's good reputation. Only 2 minutes walk to the beach. Outside Mwana, accross he street, are 2 convenient stores and a small cafeteria. Amazing staff. Safe neighborhood. I just love this place. \",\"Abdulla is a great host. He treats you like a friend and makes you feel at home. He can organize airport transfer and excursions, but compare prices with the people on the beach! Negotiate is a must on Zanzibar. It is very close to the beach, not the most beautiful beach but still very nice. It is a bit far away from Nungwi centre, with the restaurants and best beaches. (about 20 walk on the beach, but beautiful walk).\\r<br/>All in all, great value for money! Absolutely Recommendable.\\r<br/>Thanks Abdulla for our stay!\",\"Best choice for a real local staying in Nungwi. Far from the standard big resort, it is a local place, nice, tidy and clean to stay at. Located inside the village: closed to the Acquarium, the lighthouse and the fishermen place, you will need to walk 15 minutes to get to the more touristic beaches and restaurants\\r<br/>Breakfast and Wi-Fi are included and a snack shop is just in front of the place. Night guard and hot water in the room. We have been very happy with the 4 nights we spent at Abdulla' place also for his friendly and cheerful welcome. Recommended!\",\"I had a perfect stay at mwana house with my girlfriend. The room is confortable and big enoth for two persons, have a fan and in the bathroom we missed nothing. <br/>Abdulla was comme to pic us up at the airport (cheaper then the normal taxis) and he becomms our first person to talk for everything we need  for on the island. For this price i think it is a perfect place, if you see all the luxus resorts around. <br/>Thank you for everything Abdulla\",\"Abdulla was an excellent host. He really listened to our needs of traveling on a budget and was eager to arrange anything we needed. Breakfast was   great, he drove us into town and arranged a snorkeling trip for us. He has many contacts in the community and can use them to your advantage. The place is situated a very short walk to a nice beach that is not overrun with tourists or people trying to sell souvenirs. The property has fruit trees that you are welcome to and the room was large and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. \",\"Mwana house is an amazing place in Zanzibar. First of all, I felt safe, as this was my first time in Africa. I felt safe as I had the constant support from the owner Abdulla. The staff are nice, friendly and will try everything to ensure you are comfortable. Beach distance with a two minute walk and 15 minutes away to the busy beaches. Abdulla is amazing, very helpful, available and willing to cooperate in any matter. I recommend this place and thank Abdulla and all his staff in the Mwana house team. Asante Sana!\",\"Abdlulla is the MAN with a BIG open heart! Since the first day I feel like brother. Very kind, polite, joyful, ready to help/assist any time. We had great time together all days. That is the reason I was really sad to leave...\",\"Abdulla is super nice, friendly and respected man among the nungwi. You are going to be safe and well treated. The place is nice and cozy. The breakfast is simple but believe me (i eat a lot) it gets you through the day. I’d higly recomend Mwana house if you are not chasing luxury stuff but willing to interact with local  culture and different people around the world who’s staying Mwana house. Abdulla knows about best places to eat, chill, hang out and party. it was such a nice experience, i had new friends there and strongly suggest to stay in Mwana house at least for several days if you aren’t sure. If you are adventuares person like me you won’t regret! Thank you Abdulla, it was a real pleasure my friend!\",\"Abdulla was an amazing host, lots of communication and tips. Plus is always happy to help.<br/>Only problem was dodgy plug sockets, but got them to charge after a bit of fiddling.\",\"Abdulla is a friendly and helpful host who makes you feel welcome. Whatever questions you have, he answers quickly and if you need help or tips, he helps everytime and arranges everything. The bed was comfortable, the room was as described and breakfast was delicious.\",\"For those who are considering a place to stay in Zanzibar, look no further, Abdulla s place has it all. On top of his unparalleled hospitality and his willingness to go the extra 1 Thousand miles to make your stay memorable, Abdulla helped me even prior to my trip to sort out all logistics. His place has all what a traveller needs: Super clean, calm and big room, safe, great location, walking distance to the beach and nightlife spots, strong wifi and nice and varied Breakfast including a good selection of fruits. Definitely recommended.\",\"Mwana house is in a good location about a 10 minute walk from the north end of the beach. The room I had was large with its own bathroom and shower. There is a large mosquito net over the bed which was very effective in keeping me from being bitten, and the fan above the bed cooled the room somewhat. Abdullah was great at keeping in touch in the 3 month lead-up to my visit, also arranging pick up and drop off in Stone Town, and able to arrange almost anything I needed while there. He's also very personable with a great sense of humour, and interacts easily with his guests. It was nice to have a fridge to store snacks, fruit, left-overs and of course beer!! Thanks for a great stay, Abdullah!\",\"we had a pleasent stay and warm welcome at Abdulla\\\"s Mwana Guesthouse. which is located close to the beach,a short interesting walk through the village,real life of the local families and fishermen.  we enjoyed the friendly place and the kind of traveller you will meet there. Abdulla will help you with all your reqests.furthermore the staff ladies are friendly, rooms are clean, the breakfast(fruits and local baked bread) is fine.  <br/>quite a different individual place, compare to all these big resorts around Nungwi<br/>Ben and Romy / Munich\"]</td><td>4.64</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"9419723\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/9419723\"}</td><td>Nungwi, Zanzibar North, Tanzania</td><td>Nungwi, Zanzibar North, Tanzania</td><td>-5.7261</td><td>39.3027</td><td>2</td><td>null</td><td>[\"Private room in bed and breakfast\",\"1 bed\",\"1 shared bath\"]</td><td>[{\"name\":\"Cleanliness\",\"value\":\"4.7\"},{\"name\":\"Accuracy\",\"value\":\"4.7\"},{\"name\":\"Check-in\",\"value\":\"4.9\"},{\"name\":\"Communication\",\"value\":\"4.8\"},{\"name\":\"Location\",\"value\":\"4.6\"},{\"name\":\"Value\",\"value\":\"4.7\"}]</td><td>[\"Checkout before 10:00 AM\",\"2 guests maximum\"]</td><td>[\"1 bed\",\"Shared bathroom\"]</td><td>[{\"name\":\"5-min walk to the beach\",\"value\":\"This home is by Nungwi Beach.\"},{\"name\":\"Park for free\",\"value\":\"This is one of the few places in the area with free parking.\"},{\"name\":\"Room in a bed and breakfast\",\"value\":\"Your own room in a home, plus access to shared spaces.\"}]</td><td>null</td><td>[{\"group_name\":\"Bathroom\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Hot water\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_HOT_WATER\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Bedroom and laundry\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Essentials\",\"value\":\"Towels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Heating and cooling\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"AC - split type ductless system\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_SNOWFLAKE\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Internet and office\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Wifi\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_WI_FI\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Kitchen and dining\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Refrigerator\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_REFRIGERATOR\"},{\"name\":\"Dishes and silverware\",\"value\":\"Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Outdoor\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Backyard\",\"value\":\"An open space on the property usually covered in grass\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Parking and facilities\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Free parking on premises\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_MAPS_CAR_RENTAL\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Services\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Breakfast\",\"value\":\"Breakfast is provided\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Privacy and safety\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Lock on bedroom door\",\"value\":\"There is no lock on the bedroom door.\"},{\"name\":\"Kitchen\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_NO_KITCHEN\"},{\"name\":\"TV\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_NO_TV\"},{\"name\":\"Washer\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_NO_WASHER\"},{\"name\":\"Dryer\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_NO_DRYER\"},{\"name\":\"Smoke alarm\",\"value\":\"This place may not have a smoke detector.

Just one detail...the GPS indicates in one location, and the location is across the street, we lose around five minutes searching for the correct location! This happened with another tbm house. But other than that, all excellent, the problem was the GPS!\",\"Very good place, it had been other times but never in season, I thought the hotel makes the space super crowded, there is no place to sit around the pools! The standard hotel room!\",\"Sensational!! Very good hotel structure, it was my wife and two children, they love… good pools, games room, recreation with monitors, restaurant, gym, cinema…. Apartamento Top, very cozy, found it very large, air-conditioned, clean and organized, all perfect!!!

Attentive host and location was as described, clean environment, great location and with leisure and dining options.\",\"The village meets the cost-benefit expectations for a resort, having very good facilities such as pools, toys, etc. The pools are well heated, there are attractions at all times. The restaurants and cafes are also good. The cleaning that leaves a little to be desired.<br/>But if you're looking for a quiet place, don't stay there. The amount of apartments/ condominiums is very high for the structure that holds it. Places in the pool are very busy, the elevators are always crowded, there are lines all the time to climb to the apartment. The noise of the avenue at night is also quite loud.<br/>The apartment is ok, but definitely not for 6 people. We were only left, me, my husband and my son, and in this case they served us well, but there are not 6 people in this apartment, there is space to sleep in the living room, on the sofa bed, but they would have to be two children, it would be very uncomfortable for two adults.\",\"Felipe was very attentive, passed along recommendations from the place, explained about Thermas that by the way it is on the side of the building and is wonderful. There is a train to take and pick up, several restaurants in the same building, the apartment served my family, has room service, towels, which helps a lot, nice and clean space, the building surprised us, I highly recommend it.\",\"Felipe is super attentive, answered all my questions super fast. The room is super comfortable. <br/>The cleaning of the hotel left to be desired, we stayed 6 nights and the room was not cleaned any day. The period I stayed in the hotel was packed, so to get a spot in the elevator it took about 10 minutes.\",\"I recommend it well clarified\",\"Felipe is an excellent host, our stay at the hotel was wonderful, we spent 4 days staying. The ap is organized, clean and spacious, the resort is complete and is well located with everything (markets,parks, pharmacies,MC Donald's, restaurant) nearby. It exceeded our expectations.\",\"Fellipe was a great host, always helpful, and the accommodations exceeded expectations, I recommend!\",\"Clean apartment, very cozy, wonderful resort, Felipe always very attentive, the stay was very good, I will come back more times for sure.\",\"I highly recommend, host Felipe very attentive, responds and answers all questions quickly.

Even though there isn’t AC the cross winds with all the windows open and the fans made it fresh. The walk to the 3rd floor with luggage can be a workout, but this is Europe \uD83D\uDE01.  Thank- you Carlos for a very pleasant stay  - definitely would book again.\",\"Carlos is a great host! Very responsive and helpful with the checking in and out! The apartment is located in the perfect spot, right near local restaurants and bars, and steps from the beach. Definitely recommend! Apartment was clean, wifi was fast, 10/10\",\"Lovely apartment by the beach, check in was very easy with Carlos who was very attentive and quick to respond to messages. Very good value!\",\"This apartment was in a great location, you can see a little bit of sea from the balcony and get the lovely sunset colours in the sky from across the road! Loads of restaurants and shops nearby and a lovely 15 minute walk to Vilamoura (a must!).<br/>Carlos is an excellent host, extremely responsive and friendly. He arranged the taxi for us both ways which was a big help. The only slight downside is one evening the apartment above was loud, banging doors, chairs etc and no carpets as it’s European. Otherwise it’s very quiet and clean! I would definitely stay again and highly recommend it.\",\"Simply great.<br/>Spectacular hosts.<br/>Super tidy and clean apartment.<br/>A 1-minute walk to the beach ( they have toys for the kids to take to the beach.)<br/>I am always available to answer the cell phone.<br/>The space is airy and the balcony although small it has a sea view.<br/>Bed linen and towels for everyone.<br/>Very considerate of our needs.<br/>There's free parking on the back of the building.<br/>It has a mini price at 5 minutes and intermarche and pharmacy 10 minutes away by foot.<br/>Would recommend.\",\"Everything worked out great, the apartment is as it is shown in the listing. Check-in was actually only possible from 4 pm, but we were allowed to check in earlier because the apartment was ready to move into and we found that extremely nice. The apartment is right at the beach, supermarkets, promenade and also easily accessible to the city within walking distance. All in all, a good stay and recommended.\",\"Second time I'm with Carlos and as previously reviewed: MEGA.  Carlos himself is super and helpful and uncomplicated. I am available at all times and with good tips in the Repertoir.<br/>I highly recommend and have already requested the next trip with him...<br/>Carlos, muito obrigado e até breve. Abraço, Cláudio\",\"Really lovely host- our flight was delayed and we ended up getting to the Airbnb much later than originally anticipated. Carlos was so kind to wait until quite late in the night for us. The flat is super clean, and well located. Everything in Quarteira within walking distance. Thank you \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFC\",\"This place was a great deal and looked just like the pictures. Location was great and Carlos is an excellent host. The neighborhood was a bit noisy, but it felt safe and welcoming. Kitchen was well stocked and clean. Overall, an awesome stay.\",\"Very clean apartment, on the water with all amenities, perfect for a lazy stay\uD83D\uDE0E. A big thank you to our host Carlos for his kindness. We recommend it! (and will definitely go back\uD83D\uDE03)\",\"Great location and apartment. Was everything we could have asked for and more. Highly recommend.\",\"Very good stay. The apartment is at the foot of the beach. Very clean and as described.<br/>I recommend you for a journey in faro.<br/>The host is very welcoming.\",\"very close to the beach, to markets and restaurants.<br/>comfy beds, plenty of space, and a full bath.<br/>the host is very friendly. I'm present.\",\"We had a great time in Quarteira. We loved the apartment, everything was very comfortable, clean, organized and Carlos was very nice and helped us with whatever we needed. The Supermarket is on the corner, the beach is even closer, and there are good restaurants around. Location could not be better. Highly recommended!\",\"Carlos was an amazing host throughout our stay in his Airbnb. He adapted to our needs and made sure everything went nice and smooth. <br/>The flat itself is great, less than a minute away from the beach and with a lot of shops/restaurants/supermarkets around.<br/>You're also only 15/20 minutes walk away from Vilamoura and the walk is very pretty!<br/>Can't recommend enough, hope to be there again soon!!\",\"Excellent host...<br/>impeccable apartment.<br/>Thanks for the great stay\",\"Carlos is a very kind and helpful guy. The appartement was exactly like on the pictures. Open on both sides so you can make it as airy as you like. With a nice balcony on the west side, where you can relax and enjoy the sunset. You can see hear and smell the see on the balcony.  On Wednesdays there is local fruit/veggies/and other stuff-market right next to the appartement. Carlos even arranged a pick-up at the airport for me which saved me time and money. He arranged the transport back to the airport as well so I didn't have to stress to get to the airport at 6am. Thanks Carlos, I enjoyed my stay and will be back soon hopefully :)\",\"Had a great time at this very well located apartment. Carlos was extremely helpful - meeting us at midnight and letting us check out late for free as the apartment was empty the following night. Seems like he would always go out of his way to help!\",\"Carlos is a super friendly man who takes care of everything with attention, helpfulness and care. Help is no problem if needed and also took care of the transfer to the airport.<br/>The apartment is mega clean, good layout with extra bedroom and a view of the sea from the balcony, which is 100 m away. Restaurants, bars and shopping within walking distance in a minute. Also the nearest place (Vilamoura) is 10 minutes away on foot. It is fully equipped with everything.<br/>Carlos: We thank you for your hospitality and felt extremely good the week with you. We will definitely visit again\uD83E\uDD70\",\"Carlos was very welcoming, the apartment is very located a few meters from the beach and shops. 4 real places in very comfortable beds.

The area was very close to historical places and the place is in the central area, Yilmaz hosted us very well and the baklava and Turkish delight surprise made us very happy. Thank you for everything, we will come back again\",\"A great location in the old city. Walk to all the major city highlights and great local restaurants. With the perfect host\",\"Apartment well located for exploring Istanbul. Very responsive host, very accommodating.\",\"I came with my family, the apartment met our needs, everything in the kitchen <br/>there was a bathroom and the apartment was clean <br/>the living room was stylish and modernly decorated, you can stay without a second thought <br/>everything was great\",\"I would highly recommend this host and flat! It was great experience to visit Istanbul with my family! Flat is really close to old city, tram & metro station! Many great restaurants, shops around and If you want walk on coast It’s just few meters. Flat was exacly the same as on pics, clean and had whole stuff. Great communication - host always care, answer my message and help If needed! Also we get a lot recomendation about city, transport, restaurants, monuments and everything  to enjoy our visit for 100%!\",\"Yilmaz was so kind as to meet us at 2am. He communicated whenever we needed advice and gave us lots of helpful tips. The apartment is well located in an  interesting area with supermarkets cafes and restaurants and 10 mins walk to the historical centre. Our transfers to and from the airport went smoothly, thanks to Yilmaz. We'll be back \uD83D\uDC95\",\"Yilmaz arranged an amazing stay from the beginning till the end from arranging the pick from Airport till dropping us back was well organised for the price we paid for the transport seperately. the house is neatly kept and the neighbourhood is good too we stayed with our daugher who is 13 and son 12 - was very safe for families to stay and the provisions was enough for the stay. The kitchen and the bathroom could be much more groomed . The rooms are well kept and enough space and etc small room worked well to keep our luggages. I would recommend this place for stay for any of my friends\",\"Thanks to our hosts for their warm hosting and availability!<br/>Apartment matches the photos close to major tourist sites. <br/>I would recommend it.\",\"Nice cozy and clean apartment. Nothing too fancy but very conveniently located. Within walking distance from many tourist attractions. The apparent manager was responsive and thoughtful. Overall, a nice experience.\",\"Great place friendly hosts. They have bathroom shower essentials. they were so sweet and brought Turkish desserts. the place was clean and so close to ayasophia and the blue mosque.\",\"Great Airbnb! The property itself is very central and perfect for visiting all the sights of Sultanahmet. The host was kind, welcoming and even left us a box of Turkish delight. Would definitely stay again.\",\"We had a very good time, he was very kind for the flexibility of check-out\",\"Yilmaz was an excellent, proactive host that helped us from the moment we landed in Istanbul to the day we left. He was always available to arrange transport if necessary, provide anything that wasn't in the apartment, and even left us very thoughtful gifts throughout our stay.<br/>All four beds were fitted with spotless sheets, pillows, and mattress toppers when we arrived, and the kitchen and bathroom were both clean and in good working order. The location is within walking distance of Sultanahmet Square and all of its associated attractions, in addition to countless local eateries and a small supermarket.<br/>The apartment does face onto a noisy street and overlooks a park at the rear with a floodlight, so there was a little traffic noise/light at night that light sleepers should be aware of (though redundant considering the morning call to prayer.) <br/>Overall, the apartment was definitely worth the very affordable price and served as a great home-base while exploring the city.\",\"I’m sorry but this apartment is falling apart. It was very noisy, the furniture is old and broken. There are stains in the shower. I been to a lot of Airbnb and I do not recommend this stay.\",\"a very nicely located place, with a view and excellent attention\",\"Location is good, apartment a little disappointing as it need to be updated/renovated.<br/>Hosts were very nice and helpful which made our stay a little more pleasant,\",\"The apartment was spacious and airy and Ismail, the apartment manager was friendly and helpful.<br/>It was perfect place for the 4 of us to relax after a day of sightseeing.\",\"Yilmaz was a very friendly and responsive host. The apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to many restaurants and the old town is close by. Yilmaz provided local recommendations for dining and sightseeing, which was very helpful.<br/>Just a word about the noise in the apartment...  The front bedroom is a little noisy, but it is on street level, so this is to be expected. However, the smaller 3rd bedroom had the water heater in it and this unfortunately made noise during the night.<br/>Overall our stay was quite pleasant.\",\"Location is good, host was so helpful and communicative that you can’t even imagine, flat itself was good, especially beds it was unreal comfort.<br/>Yilmaz helped with our luggage , he helped to keep it in warehouse after check out and even organized transfer from apartment to airport, <br/>Thanks so much Yilmaz, best wishes\",\"excellent everything highly recommend.\",\"Apartment is very well located in relation to the main tourist sites, in a popular and typical neighborhood.<br/>The kitchen is quite outdated, is summarily equipped both in terms of appliances and dishes. Not all of the advertised amenities are there.<br/>Our host did not introduce us to all the amenities ( especially those located outside the apartment) and were not responsive to our requests.<br/>Only 2 out of 3 bedrooms are air-conditioned and the bedroom on the street is very noisy.\",\"Nice and lovely host and very nice and cozy house\",\"It was an accommodation where you can see the sea and Sultan Ahmet Mosque at the same time. Originally it was on the first floor, but the host was assigned to the 4th floor as a suggestion, so the scenery was better. It is easy to get around with sightseeing spots that are close by walking. The hosts were very hospitable, were actively available and responsive. He is a great host in a great city.\",\"Great place to stay that is within walking distance to many historical sites and great restaurants in Kumkapı.

Everything is simple, perfect for a couple of days' stay to relax well. As for the drawbacks, I'll note that the heater in the bathroom was not working, but it's not critical.<br/>There's a good café nearby where you can have a delicious breakfast. Detailed instructions on how to find the chalet were provided before our arrival, so it wasn't difficult to get there. Tanja is a responsive and hospitable host. Thank you!\",\"I stayed at Tanja's place for 7 nights.  If you want a good night sleep this is the place to be since the area is very quiet. The apartment is warm, clean and has a fully equiped kitchen if you want to cook. If someday they build the gondola that should go up to the ski resort, this will be the perfect place to stay.\",\"Good apartment near the Kopaonik. Theoretically it is possible to ski almost near it.  I did not try but a lot of people skied there. Kopaonik is not so far but in ,it may take 30 min to go there by car. It depends on the weather conditions.<br/>Apartment is small but the size is OK for two people. It contains everything that u may need for stay. So it is a good choose if u have a car and want to save money.\",\"Tanja’s apartment is a good value for the price if you want to go skiing in Kopaonik. Located about 20 minutes drive up the hill to the center of the ski slopes, the appartment is surrounded by the mountains in a quiet area. If you arrive by car, make sure to bring your snow chain, as driving to the apartment can be challenging sometimes... :)<br/>Also be aware that there are a lot of stairs you have to climb to get to the apartment, which are usually covered in snow and ice, so you have to be very careful with your steps.<br/>Tanja was very helpful and she always replied immediately to our questions. Altogether we were very satisfied with the apartment. <br/>Thank you, Tanja! :)\",\"Plus:<br/>Very good value for money. Location is fantastic. Kitchen has all necessary things that we needed.<br/>Tanja is very friendly and professional host.<br/>Minus: <br/>The bed in the bedroom is very hard. I have back pain so it was very uncomfortable for me. <br/>It wasn’t perfectly clean. It should be cleaner.\",\"I like the villa location, it’s with good views, the parking lot nearby the villa, the house equipped 14’ LCD TV, the bed need guest DIY, if it’s ready when guest coming that’s great!\",\"Perfect place to stay. Very helpful owner.\",\"The location is ok, although at the foot of the hill.There is a cable car at the door, but we went without driving.We are rushing from the capital. I personally feel that it is good at the foot of the homestay at the foot of the mountain. The next day, we will go to the snow mountain for half an hour. If the homestay is directly on the mountain, it is dangerous to go to the snow mountain at night.The host also helped us contact the instructor, but finally didn't ask for a trainer because the child was sick.\",\"Phenomenal, clean, and quiet place.

The livingroom and bedroom have airconditioning which is really nice since summer can be very hot in Sarajevo. The shower was not so great on the other hand and the apartment is located on the top floor without an elevator. So you’ll need to take the stairs.

The apartment itself was really clean and nice with all amenities we could ask for, even traveling with our two-year-old. Rialda was a great host, always available to help out with any questions. Also, a small but perhaps important note: the wi-fi in the apartment was really good.\",\"Very good location and nice place \uD83D\uDC4C\",\"Would recommend to anyone who is visiting Sarajevo\",\"Rialda’s apartment was awesome. I can’t imagime any better location for a downtown apartment in a capital. Parking just on the other side of the street. Main street is just 10 seconds from the door. Rialda was very kind.

The best location, in center of Sarajevo old town just a few seconds from everything. Everything is well organized and a host Rialda responding very fast on every question.  She left us bottle of wine for welcoming. Great experience\",\"We stayed in Sarajevo with a family of 4 and we really liked this apartment. It is much better than in the photos, located in the very center, on a tourist pedestrian street, but at the same time it is very quiet - you can't hear the sounds of the street at all. The apartment is equipped with everything you need - coffee, several varieties of tea, all appliances are fresh, the bathroom also has everything you need. Literally a stone's throw from the apartment there is a great pastry shop, a chic cormorant shop and the best ¥evabdžinica in town )<br/>Separately, I want to thank Rialda for allowing us to check in early after a sleepless night and check out later before the return trip. It literally saved us! If we find ourselves in Sarajevo again, we will definitely stay here.\",\"If this place is available, do yourself a favor and book it: you won't do better in Sarajevo.<br/>Perfect location, well equipped, warm (in the winter), very comfortable.

A curvy exterior, built around one of the tiny side streets of the old town.   Our house is steeped in history, and is shown multiple times with old photos in the town centre of Tolmin.Our house is ideally located less than 850m from the festival venue in Tolmin..punk rock, metal days, reggae & the soca river, ideal for water sports enthusiasts, hikers and paragliding.The spaceThe house if fantastically located in the centre of Tolmin and walking distance to the festivals, for example metal days/punk/reggae are just 850m walking. It is ideal if you do not want to have a car. There are many restaurants and bars all within walking distance, as well as various shops and a supermarket. The beach area is also 850m walk. The national park and gorges are 2km away.Our house is one of the closest rental properties you can get to the beautiful Soca Valley river in Tolmin, where the festivals and water activities take place, and where you access the river by walking down the the Dijaška Ulica road. It's location means  you can walk to all the amenities; supermarkets, bars, and restaurants, and beach area.. A modern kitchen and dining area, with table and seating for 5,  hob, oven,  as well as a log burner with an exposed chimney flu.. There is additionally a  downstairs cloakroom/utility.Upstairs there are two bedrooms, one with its  own ensuite shower room, and another shower room, both with underfloor heating.  There is a further mezzanine level in the attic with 1 single bed . This attic  is a low level ceiling great for older children; however you cannot stand up in it, so unsuitable for adults. This attic  level is also unsuitable for toddlers or very small children, due to the stairs being very steep, and also a toddler or small child could climb in between the bannisters.You will see that our house is made of natural 1850's year old stone, with it being exposed in many places. And whilst the house does  get dusty due to the natural stone walls breathing, we have installed the Mitsubishi M Series fur heating and air conditioning. This system has air purification through advanced V blocking  filter, neutralising bacteria, viruses, allergens, dust and mould.  This also works via an efficient heat pump to help us contribute to the sustainability targets in each country. There is solid 1850's original wooden flooring throughout the upper level.TV works the internet.If you are expecting a modern house, with smooth straight edges, and clinically clean like a hospital, don't book this house! It is curvy, bumpy walls, some are stone, and rustic old doors,  however it is full of character and very unique in its shape.BEDSAll our beds are IKEA beds, with medium to firm mattresses.SUSTAINABILITYOur Renovations..When carrying out our renovations of our old properties (two out of the three are around 200 years old), we have kept many of the original features, including; wooden beams and wooden flooring, stone feature sink, old concrete radiators, as well as using reclaimed bricks in some of our flooring.Our Furnishings including Bed LinenWhere possible, all furnishings have been up-cycled, reupholstered, or sourced sustainably. We have sourced 95% of our bed linen from companies that are committed to a sustainable supply and manufacturing process. We do wash all our bedlinen at 60 degrees (since Covid).Heating and Air conditioning is via an efficient heat pump. Hot water is also via a heat pump.  Rubbish and RecyclingSlovenia has been named one of the greenest countries in the world. Everyone who lives here plays their part in helping this cause. When you come to Slovenia, you also need to acknowledge your responsibilities like the residents, and follow the countries rules regarding recycling. These are not just our house rules.  Please play your part by contributing to recycling your rubbish in the different bins. Further instructions are on the fridge (there is no rubbish collection for recyclable items).Guest accessAll of the houseOther things to noteParking is available through many places around the town centre, and in the side streets.2.5 euros tourist tax per person per night is due in addition the price paid for your holiday (this is 2025 government rates).Attic level unsuitable for small children or toddlers, and tall persons due to low level ceilings.

Place itself was great too, a lot of space and a very good location.<br/>Would love to stay here next time.\",\"As a festival visitor, the location was ideal for this. Communication was top notch and everything worked out well. Had everything you needed. Unfortunately, it was not thoroughly cleaned, even if you are not sensitive and do not have great requirements. Although the house is old, this should be possible. It had a lot of cobwebs, even in places where it is very visible and you move a lot (door, balcony, etc.). Otherwise everything is ok so far.\",\"nice house, good location, super easy check-in/out, good communication. nice overall experience.\",\"A beautiful home steeped in history but with modern comforts. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the location in tomlin is ideal for walking to shops, cafes, restaurants, tourist info and the beaches. Linda was an attentive and helpful host with some great tips to enhance our stay. we would live to return as a family and stay for longer next time\",\"Linda's house was perfectly located for both the shops and restaurants in Tolmin as well as the festival we were attending by the river. The house is really spacious inside with plenty space for 4 of us to sleep, relax, eat and so on. It's got a lot of rustic charm and Linda made the whole process of checking in and out really simple.\",\"The house is spacious, having now an electric grill, fully equipped and comfy 2 bedrooms, the third room on the top (3beds) are mostly okay only to go to sleep or for short people, or children as the ceiling is around 150CM tall. It was very easy to communicate with Linda, who always responded promptly. The check-in was easy even remotely. The location is central, which we liked a lot and you could find free parking space not too far as well. <br/>The cleanness was just 4 starts from 5, and we are not picky. The bathrooms were not super clean, but we could live with that. Be careful that the waste needs to be selectively collected, but there is only one bin, and you can not dispose of it mixed anywhere in the city. There is a public collection point near the bakery at the parking places, within walkable distance. Also if you did not know there are scorpions in Slovenia. We found one inside on the first night, not dangerous though. At least according to the internet. The top room, or more like an open space as it has no doors, is warm, and not too comfortable for adults. Mostly for children as the ceiling is low, but okay to just go to sleep. <br/>The Living room and the kitchen is perfect for gathering cooking and grilling with a new electric grill at the terrace. We loved it and made dinner several nights. The house next door is being renovated inside, which can cause some noise for the next 2-3 months if you sleep with windows open expect to be woken around 7-7:30.\",\"We were three guys staying at Linda's place for a week during Metaldays 2018. We just loved the place. We couldn't have had a better location for our purpose. Less than a kilometer walking distance to the festival area. Everything was exactly as expected and described by the host. Communication between ourselves and the host was excellent from the start. Highly recommended :)<br/>Hans, 53, from Norway\",\"great place to stay.\",\"We spent nice days in Tolmin. The house  is very lovely to stay and you can reach several destinations in rather short  time. I like very much the style of the House and felt at home very quick. Thanx for the reduced way of renovating-itś calming.\",\"I booked this apartment through Airbnb for a holiday with my children. The place was more like a cellar than a house, and the cleaning was extremely Inadequate. There were spider webs, dust. In the kitchen the walls were black and dirty with an unknown substance. Spider webs were in all of the fans, dust on the curtains, the toilet brush in the bathroom was black, and black mold was on the floor of one of the showers. I am concerned that two of the heaters had asbestos. On the table outside the ashtray was still dirty, and neither me or my kids smoke. Some spots on the floor were impossible to walk on because of the broken wood (my son fell down because of this) and cords were exposed near the television. The bathrooms and showers were so small that it was difficult for a taller person to shower, and heavy winter sheets were put on one of the beds in the middle of August! It was 40 degrees celsius inside of the house, and when i asked for lighter sheets i was given grey sheets instead of white. Half of the lightbulbs were blown out in one of the hanging lights. My daughter even had an allergy attack due to the amount of dust. Booking this house ruined my holiday and I would not recommend it to anyone... I think that airbnb has to cancell this listing, to avoid that other guests have the same bad surprise... My holiday has been ruined!!!!!! I think that this apartment is a fraud.\",\"Everything as expected, nice house. Perfectly placed for Punk Rock Holiday festival, would stay here again!\",\"A very nice house in the centre of Tolmin. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this house. Excellent communication from the host as well!\",\"Linda was super nice, the location was cool furs Butik festival but the place was not very clean\",\"Beautifully renovated appartment. Located in the characteristic old center of Tolmin. \",\"Great location!\",\"A great accommodation with everything you need and space for four with two bedrooms each with its own bathroom. Great hosts who responded quickly. Very happy to come back.\"]</td><td>4.38</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"12490861\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/12490861\"}</td><td>Tolmin, Slovenia</td><td>Tolmin,

We were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness and homely quality of the apartment. It felt like staying at a family member's house! Everything was clean and we had access to everything we needed during our stay. Their apartment design is down to the details, there are even umbrellas for rainy weather. We would definitely rebook this lovely apartment next time we visit Rome.\",\"Very nice and pretty apartment in a vibrant area in Rom! We really enjoyed our stay and felt at home. <br/>Luana was a great host! Besides our last minute booking she arranged an earlier check-in. We would love to stay there another time. Thank you\",\"I had a wonderful experience in this apartment. <br/>I felt at home, a cozy, clean and well equipped apartment near the best restaurants of Rome, and a pleasant walk distance to the city’s main touristic attractions.<br/>I would happily come back again in my next visit to Rome :) thanks Luana and Maurizio!\",\"Great location at the edge of town.\",\"Communication from Luana and Maurizio was fantastic-they were quick to answer queries prior to booking and were very helpful and prompt in replying to further messages. The apartment was beautiful and location was great-it is close to lots of local bars, restaurants and shops, and only a 30min walk from the main attractions. Thank you very much for a really enjoyable stay.\",\"Luana and Maurizio could not have been more helpful. They responded really quickly when we asked about something. The flat is just how it appears on the pictures. It was very clean. A previous review said that the street was quiet, when we were there there was noise from a bar, but don't let that put you off. Unless you are a very light sleeper it's ok and the flat is very good to stay in. We walked to most places from the flat without having to go too far. I would stay again.\",\"Location was great, live music, wonderful food close by, gelato next door, beautiful walks through a gorgeous city, taxi stands a block away, views out the windows. It was great. Our host were the best with options and suggestions, very prompt and helpful. Check out the bathroom chandelier, I loved it. Thank you for a wonderful visit.\",\"A 10<br/>Everything!!!!\",\"Luana & Maurizio were fabulous hosts!  They responded immediately to any question, met us upon our arrival and departure to ensure everything went smoothly, and were most helpful with transportation logistics, sightseeing and restaurant recommendations.  We loved their sunny, clean home!  We would do it again.  Bravo!\",\"No complaints, everything went perfectly well, we didn't fully enjoy our stay. In addition, the place is on the edge of a lively and fun neighborhood.\",\"Luana & Maurizio’s place was everything that we were looking for!! I was fulfilling a promise to my 72 year old mother, to bring her to the Vatican and get some Roma flavor too, and our stay at Casa Rossi made our trip super easy and enjoyable. Even before booking they replied with the best intentions about my mom’s needs (not too many stairs, accessible for elderly, etc). So I felt confident about booking and I didn’t regret a bit! They were super helpful and kind in each of our exchanges. The house felt like home as we found everything we could possibly need. My mom was particularly happy with the super clean and well equipped kitchen. I was also super happy with their flexibility with check in and check out. Very considerate about our requests and also super approachable. Highly recommended!\",\"Great location and the<br/>apartment is equipped with everything!! 100% Recommended.\",\"Laura and Maurizio's place was just what we wanted - comfortable, well-equipped, and right in the midst of the Trastavere walking area.

We like the environment and we think about renting again.<br/>note: Only negative point is that they ask us to leave earlier than the contracted time, we left 1h earlier. pq would clean the apartment for another family.\",\"Great apto! We'll be back for sure! The condominium is very nice, has all the infra you need for the beach! I took my cat, I had no problem, there is a screen in all the windows. Comfortable, clean, the unit faces the pool, in short, we are already planning to return to Ubatuba and stay in the same apartment.\",\"The sugar from the kitchen dirty, bathroom comes out water under the box I'm all wet, they don't leave the minimum cleaning product, no dishcloth, they leave 2 floor cloth if you need no more, horrible old couch, bad couple mattress too soft old at last the only good thing is 9 air conditioning, they need a lot of improvements I've been in Ap in the same Condominium and much better.\",\"The apartment was in perfect condition, the condominium was very cozy, also clean and well maintained, we had no setbacks, everything was perfect from our arrival until we left.<br/>Aline was always attentive to our messages, she was cordial, generous, we are grateful!\",\"I always go to the Passaredo condominium, Aline is always very nice to us, we've been renting only with her for about 4 years, I love this condominium, and this time it was also very cool in Silvio's apartment, thanks for the stay, I already want to go back!\",\"Aline always very active, gave us good tips and always responds quickly… I also help in anticipating the checkin .

The bachelor mattresses are foams that feel the floor. I went on vacation for the second time at the same time, but this time I left disappointed, almost 3,000 for a week of nervousness. I won't come back!\",\"Our  stay was wonderful,within the expected I and my family, the condominium presents good security,  co-host Aline responds quickly, passing the necessary guidelines, close to the market, bakery that could go walking . All by listing, condominium with several swimming pools, game room, covered parking next to the elevator . We like it and  we intend to return, it was worth it!\",\"perfect apartment..

We very much like the condominium, very quiet, there is no mess, well organized. The pools are great.\",\"It was good, I just didn't like the pressure to get out. The hostess had warned that the checkout was at 12:00, but I was with young children and it took me a while to get out. It could have a higher tolerance for checkout. The housekeeper arrived at noon on point and we had to leave in despair. That was very unpleasant. At least 30 minutes of tolerance should be given at least 30 minutes of tolerance, mainly taking into account being with young children.<br/>Another thing I didn't like very much was that the suite is for the bedroom that has the bunk beds and not the bedroom that has the double bed. The couple has to use the social bathroom. Something bypassable, but it's good to know in advance if the couple wants privacy.<br/>The rest is fine.\",\"Thanks Aline for your hospitality. <br/>we sincerely thank you for all clarity and agility in our conversations.  we recommend staying both in the app and for friends and family. <br/>#Super indico!! <br/>great day for you.\",\"Very handsome apartment with elevator , slightly old stove, torn sofa, slightly dirty barbecue, old laundry room, extremely uncomfortable couple mattress.<br/>Apartamento is in front of the pool much noise of both conversation and water as it has a house.

Thank you \uD83D\uDE09\",\"Everything was great, thank you for your hospitality\",\"We enjoyed our stay at Gvantsa’s apartment. <br/>The apartment is very spacious and has everything you may need. <br/>The building is new, quiet, and very modern. <br/>I would definitely recommend the place because staying in the old town allows you to walk everywhere and the building is right next to the boardwalk.\",\"The location was fantastic! It's one of the key landmarks in Batumi's northern area, with the beach, Ali & Nino, and the Alphabetic Tower just a short walk away. Moreover, the room is neat, roomy, and comfortable for a single guest or a couple, offering a beautiful view of the mountains and the ocean from the window!\",\"We really enjoyed our stay at the place right at the heart of the city. There are nice beaches, restaurants, promenades nearby with amazing breakfasts and lunches. The host is very helpful and friendly! Highly recommended!\",\"You can walk around. The view is beautiful. The kitchen was empty, there was no tea and refreshments as shown in the photos.\",\"Everything was perfect just no ventilation in the shower and it's a rope maybe you can install a Venta and everything will be fine we had a great time.\",\"The space was identical to the description and comfortable , if you want to walk in the surrounding area it will be all around you you don't need a taxi or rent a car\",\"Good\",\"Absolutely loved this sunny, cozy, well-located apartment, equipped with everything you might need. There was an issue on day 1,  which the host solved in no time. I'll definitely keep this place in mind during my next visit to Batumi.\",\"Overall, it was fine. The furniture is a bit worn out, and there's some mold in the bathroom. The toiletries aren't the freshest. However, the decor is nice, and the location and price are excellent.\",\"Great apartment with a beautiful view from the window, warm, cozy, you can always contact the host. I recommend it!\",\"Thank you so much!!! Everything went great!!!\",\"The building is in a very central spot<br/>I came to 15 from the airport with the bolt application that is very easy to access, the apartment was on the 11th floor, it has a very comfortable area with an open kitchen, a bathroom, a large washing machine, there is a refrigerator, the kitchen and the counter are very sufficient, the materials are heated with enough air conditioning in the kitchen, although it was winter, I did not have any problems at all, two 3 minutes by walking to the beach, very close to the Nino statue, the alphabet tower<br/>There is a bar nearby called chacha Time<br/>There are many places that you can have breakfast and coffee<br/>The house is clean<br/>Bathroom clean<br/>It's time for the towels to change<br/>The elevators are small but fast<br/>I didn't wait during the winter<br/>It was a nice experience<br/>Thanks\",\"The view is amazing, and you can even enjoy it when falling asleep and waking up, from the bed\"]</td><td>4.88</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"324557738\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/324557738\"}</td><td>Batumi, Adjara, Georgia</td><td>Batumi, Adjara,

Message for details of what's on before you book.One of 10 Self Catering  cottages. Facilities include: shared indoor heated pool and garden/BBQ area. Central Exmoor location close to towns of Minehead and Dulverton, lots of picturesque local villages, and local attractions.Electricity paid by meter reading, 25p/unit. Free Internet Access (speeds vary due to rural location). No children under 7 years old as located above Juniper Cottage.The spaceTriscombe Farm is situated in Exmoor National Park within its own valley location. The 10 self catering cottages are in a hamlet-like environment and are mostly converted farm buildings. We are 1 mile away from Wheddon Cross and 10 miles away from Minehead. We are centrally located in Exmoor National Park, ideal for walkers and those looking to explore the area, whilst still being close to nearby towns and villages. Wheddon Cross is the highest village on Exmoor and is close to Dunkery Beacon, the highest point on Exmoor. On a clear day from Dunkery Beacon, you can see for miles around, to Wales and all of the surrounding countryside. There are plenty of places to visit in the area regardless of your interests, whether you want to have an active holiday with watersports, visit National Trust properties, visit family attractions or simply enjoy time away from home. Information about a large number of attractions and places to visit is provided in our online guidebook.The swimming pool uses a  booking system to ensure fair usage of the pool. The link for booking will be sent to guests prior to arrival if the pool is open during your stay (closed until Feb 2024). Please note that we are awaiting new updated photos of the cottages so the photos currently on this listing are pre-covid19 adaptations.Guest accessStream is a private self-contained cottage with access only given to the guests staying in the cottage. We have an emergency key to the cottage which is only used if we need to gain access in an emergency. The swimming pool, games room and gardens are all shared areas, shared only with other guests staying on site and occasional family use. All guests are given keys to the swimming pool and games room, in addition to their individual cottage. Unfortunately we cannot accept bookings that include children under 7 years of age. This is because Stream is situated above Juniper cottage.Other things to note*** N.B. The water supply is Natural Spring Water  (regularly tested) and not SW Water***There are 9 other self catering cottages on site. We do not accept pets as we are a livestock farm but we do have a Labrador called Max (trained to stay away from animals), as well as four farm cats so please be aware that animals live on site. Jake (Black and white male cat) and Mitzi (Tabby female) sometimes come and say hello to guests but should not be let into the cottages. Electricity is charged at 25p/unit to guests during their stay. This is to allow guests to have more control over the cost of their stay and to reduce the risk of electricity being used unnecessarily. The tariff is priced to reflect the additional charge of electricity. Payment is preferable either through AirBnB as an additional service, however alternate methods of payment are available.</td><td>Stays</td><td>true</td><td>null</td><td>[\"Ruth was an awesome host. <br/>Great facilities. <br/>Gorgeous cottage (Stream)<br/>Great location.<br/>Beautiful grounds to roam. <br/>Great games room.<br/>Easy booking system for the pool. Immediate confirmation and a great addition with no additional fee to use.<br/>Thank you Ruth for a wonderful stay.\",\"Fantastic stay for a family holiday. Beautiful location, spotlessly clean, friendly host. Kids loved the pool and evening barbecues on the hillside. Would recommend and will stay again!\",\"We loved Stream Cottage. It was spotlessly clean on arrival. The shared garden that was beside the property was lovely. We ate breakfast and dinner in the garden using the BBQ space too.<br/>The swimming pool was a great bonus. <br/>Ruth and Becky communicated very well with us. We had a fabulous break and intend to return sometime with our grandchildren.\",\"Lovely place to stay,very peaceful… the children loved the pool and Ruth and Becky were very accommodating to us.<br/>Only a little issue was with the TV signal so we couldn’t watch tv all weekend.. ( not a bad thing ) but two children obviously wanted to watch it, but Becky bought over a lot of DVDS …. X\",\"Amazing cottage for a quiet and peaceful get away. Pool is big and the temperature of water is warm, beds are as comfortable as clouds, massive garden with a bbq area and most importantly nature all around with not a single sound of cars coming by. I would 100% recommend for anyone who wants to get away from a busy city.\",\"Nice enough place. Fairly basic, but fair value and a pretty farm. Quite a lot of rules to contend with/ adjust around, so good if you want to know exactly what to expect/ feel assured that you're totally Covid safe, but possibly not for everyone if you prefer a little more feel of independence.\",\"A+\"]</td><td>4.71</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"54571862\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/54571862\"}</td><td>Wheddon Cross, England, United

Very quick to respond and friendly. <br/>Their home was warm, welcoming and beautifully designed. It was clean with plenty of rooms and good amenities. The location suited us slightly out of the main street,  near the beach and local food places.<br/>Thank you for having us.\",\"Really nice of her to share everything in the kitchen.<br/>We cooked a pasta meal for 6 pax just in 30mins, bought a roasted chicken for $12 from Cole in Cowes. House has heater in both bathrooms to keep warm.<br/>Really good to sleep 8 pax, have living room for <br/>activity. Lots of boardgames for little ones.<br/>Just no WiFi.\",\"Everything as described, great spot.\",\"House was extremely clean. The bnb was warm and cozy. Kylie was a great host, effective communication.\",\"Very comfortable and clean home. Great for our short stay close to Churchill Island and San Remo. Host provided excellent communication before our stay and provided amenities for our use which was very heart warming and I would highly recommend them and use them again in the near future if available.\",\"At Phillip Island for the MOTO GP - a birthday prezzie for my hubby! <br/>The house at Cape Woolamai was perfect - it was clean tidy and pretty much had everything we needed for our 3 night stay! <br/>We had a friend with us so the two bathrooms were a bonus! <br/>The house is walking distance to a parade of shops and a fabulous pub! <br/>A bus stop is also located near the shops with buses to take you around the Island! <br/>We never explored the garden or hot tub as too busy but seating outside in two areas is a bonus also. <br/>Comms with Kylie was easy,  prompt and friendly. <br/>Would highly recommend the house.\",\"Everything was great.\",\"Kylie’s house is great for a getaway. It’s a great size, clean and conveniently located. Walking distance to both the Cape Woolamai shops and the beach. We would happily stay there again.\",\"We enjoyed out stay at Kylie's property over the long weekend. Great location in Cape Woolamai, close to shops and short drive/walks to beach, and is very convenient to visit all attractions in the island. I would recommend this place to any one,  very clean and tidy.\",\"Would recommend Kylie's place.  Communication was great.  House was as described.  Location great for exploring the area and visiting the beaches.  Kitchen was really well stocked and plenty of board games to keep the family amused.  Only drawback was no aircon or fans in the bedrooms.  There is a unit in the living area that kept us all cool, but with the hot, muggy weather, we struggled to sleep at night.\",\"A great location close to shops and beaches. The house is clean and well equiped.\",\"Lovely,  fresh and well laid out house. <br/>Great location - close to shops and beach. <br/>Kylie and Alan were very friendly and helpful. <br/>Highly recommend this stay.\",\"We loved our stay at Kylie’s everything we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay. Loved the relaxing chairs and big yard. Close to beaches and all attractions on the island only a short drive away.<br/>Would highly recommend!\",\"Enjoyed our stay here again. Nice house in a good location with everything you need for a relaxing holiday. Thanks Kylie.\",\"Lovely location, great place to stay with a family. Highly recommended.\",\"I couldn't recommend Kylie's house high enough, It had everything we needed.  It was sparkling clean, with Lots of DVDs'd, Books and games to keep us amused.  Close to everything,   nice stroll to the beach to watch the sunset.   Kylie was easy to communicate with and we certainly felt at home there.  We most definitely will be staying there again if Kylie  will have us.  Thank you Kylie your house is fantastic\",\"Kylie’s place is super lovely. We felt right at home with the personal touches and great customer service. Would highly recommend\"]</td><td>4.89</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"153303375\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/153303375\"}</td><td>Cape Woolamai, Victoria, Australia</td><td>Cape Woolamai,

local speciality, make you go back and forth between your bivouac and the shop. The traditional beach cabins, which are set out in a line on the sand, offer a \\\"farniente and sand castle\\\" appointment in season. Be warned, it often ends in a drink with the neighbours!Along the shoreline, for almost 7 km, restaurants line the sand and the seawall. Breweries, seafood specialities, ice cream parlours or beer bars, what will you choose?In the high season, we advise you to book your table if you want to have the choice.The dike is lined with a wide cycle path and you will always find a safe place to tie up your steed.

Not to mention the 15m swimming pool which allowed us to do nice laps in order to make up the fruits acquired in the excellent restaurant addresses handed over by Alba.<br/>Alba and Andrew are adorable, very considerate with lots of sincerity.<br/>The geographical location is ideal for discovering Tuscan, its magnificent landscapes as far as the eye can see, identical to those that can be found in Italian paintings, ( refer to the backgrounds of the picture of the Mona Lisa!) also discover Siena, Florence and all villages within a maximum of 45 minutes by car.<br/>The cherry on the cake: Andrew who plays the piano just at the time of our breakfast in the garden!!!<br/>Grazié Millé!<br/>See you again.<br/>Franck\",\"The location is incredible. The fienile apartment itself unbelievable, with a wide view of the rolling hills with olives and vineyards. Spotless, with great amenities (pool, wifi, kitchen, aircon for those who want it). The hosts are incredibly charming, personal - truly wonderful people who make you feel like you've been in the family forever. <br/>Couldn't recommend more highly - can't wait to return.\",\"What an amazing place.  the best view in all of Tuscany and the pool is heaven.  No need to leave ever.  relaxing and we will definitely be back\",\"After a couple weeks traveling during a historic heat wave in Italy, this villa was exactly the peaceful retreat my family needed! We still can’t believe our luck in finding it, because it was absolutely perfect. Alba & Sonny were incredibly kind and helpful, offering suggestions, food, and even helping us get a very last minute dinner reservation. The villa itself was beautiful, with such a thoughtful mix of antique & mid-century decor with lovely art in every corner. It was also spacious, extremely clean, and so comfortable. The garden and views were simply stunning, and the pool was such a treat after hot days exploring. We really wish we could’ve stayed longer, and hope to return someday!\",\"Stunning views and an absolutely beautiful house. Very spacious, it was lovely to be able to unpack and organise our belongings after travelling out of suitcases for 2 weeks. The hosts were great at offering local suggestions and always on hand to help.\"]</td><td>4.98</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"3908415\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/3908415\"}</td><td>Barberino Tavarnelle, Tuscany, Italy</td><td>Barberino Tavarnelle, Tuscany,

Amenities offered were over and above - from shampoo to Q-tips, hair straightener and many, many more !!  After day one, host checked with us to ensure all was well - you could tell our host wanted us to have an outstanding experience - which we did !!  Would rate our stay 6 stars, but rating system only reaches to 5 !!!  Loved this place !!\",\"This was the second time we have rented this property, excellent hostess and accommodations.  Everything you would ever need is made available to you, hostess checked in to see how we were doing and if everything was going smoothly.  We entertained a fair bit during the week and everyone was very impressed with the property.  Surprisingly there were very few bugs or mosquitos, not sure if that is due to timing of our stay or proactive measures taken by Shelley.   The deck can be confined if you have little kids running around, which we did.  Would not hesitate to return!!\",\"Shelly’s place was fantastic! It’s spacious and extremely cozy from the nice couch for lounging to the comfy beds and bedding in the bedrooms. Feels like home with all the beautiful plants inside and out and nice to have laundry, bbq, and a kitchen with lots of dishes utensils. The deck is gorgeous and great for toddlers too with gates and umbrellas. This is the perfect place to getaway for a few days and enjoy nature. Nice little beach nearby and right next to beautiful Granite hills golf course. Everything is well stocked and felt very clean and inviting. Shelly is very responsive and accommodating. We hope to be back again next year!\",\"The most well stocked cabin we’ve ever stayed in as could not think of one more thing we would’ve needed. Shelly is a very friendly host and very responsive to any questions or needs you have would definitely stay here again.\",\"The cabin was very nicely appointed, everything from kitchen utensils to garden furniture to firewood.  It exceeded our expectations as far as what was provided, extras like kitchen spices.  Host was very amiable, always there if needed and kept in touch to make sure things went as planned.  Lots of parking, beds and linens were fantastic.  Loved the kitchen island for serving up breakfast.  Deck furniture was very comfortable for the afternoon, bonfire with the group was fantastic.  Very happy with everything, look forward to next year if available.\",\"My friend and I absolutely loved our stay. The place was beautiful and in excellent condition. The nicest  AirBnB I have stayed in by far! It was refreshing to say somewhere that matched the pictures.<br/>Shelly was super friendly, helpful and responsive as a host. <br/>Location was great for my friend and I as we were looking for a quiet winter getaway.\",\"Thank you Shelly!! We had a fabulous week away! Your place is beautiful, inviting, has everything we needed to feel right at home.  Your place exceeded our expectations! You are a fabulous host and always quick to respond to any concern.  Definitely would love to go back next summer! It's a perfect getaway and so close to get in some golfing. Thank you!!\",\"What a wonderful cabin, great  space to spend a week and relax with the family.<br/>The cabin was well kept and the furniture and beds were very comfortable, clean linens and lots of blankets to cozy up together and watch a movie. The outdoor space was great, nice private back yard with a fire pit to sit around and roast marshmallows. <br/>The cabin had all the amenities you would need, the only thing that would make this place better is if there was a nice beach within walking distance.\",\"A wonderful place to stay! We picked this spot for the golf course and it was so close. It was a beautiful place that exceeded expectations. Everything was clean and the kitchen was fully functional which made it easy to cook. The couch is so comfy and lots of throw blankets to get cozy. It was the perfect spot to take our 1 year old for the week.\",\"Shelly’s place is as amazing as advertised! She has thoughtfully stocked the cabin with some extras (shampoo, tinfoil, a spice cupboard) and don’t forget something for the dogs (beds and a super fun toy box!). She is very responsive to questions and concerns and responds very quickly! I would recommend her place in a heartbeat for a wonderful getaway!!\",\"Highly recommend Shelly’s home. Beautiful, clean, comfortable and well stocked with everything you could possibly need. Beautiful, quiet location and Shelly was a dream to work with. 5 stars isn’t nearly enough. Shelly has thought of everything!  We will definitely be back. It was the perfect spot for a week away with our adult children and their dogs. The beds are so comfortable, the living room is large and open with lots of room for visiting and some board games. It’s the perfect get away spot. Thanks Shelly for sharing your beautiful home with us and allowing us to make some wonderful family memories!\",\"Beautiful home! The house was comfortable, clean, and incredibly well equipped with extra little touches here and there that made our stay feel special. Communication with Shelly was fantastic. We are looking forward to staying again in the future.\",\"Our second visit to Shelly’s beautiful lake home. Enjoyed bonfire pit, walking, and all the amenities of this location and cottage. Would definitely recommend.\",\"Beautiful home, very spacious. LOVED the 3 bathrooms. Shelly thought of several little extras, and the spice cupboard is incredible. Quiet neighbourhood, we went for walks every day. And if you need anything the store is only 2 minutes away by car. Water is non-potable so a bit of a hassle but water cooler jugs are provided.\",\"A fabulous open concept house in a convenient location to Granite Hills Golf Course, boat launch access and hiking trails.  The spacious indoor and outdoor spaces are set up beautifully for socializing with family and friends or carving out some quiet time.  Shelly is a most attentive host.  If any questions should arise, her response time is impeccable.  Highly recommend this accommodation. We will definitely book again. Be sure to make time to float the Pinawa Channel.<br/>T&D\",\"Shelly was very accomodating all througout our stay. She responded quickly to my messages and provided us with all the informations we need a head of time. Her place is super nice, clean, and tidy. My friends and I really had an amazing time to bond during our stay.  We are definitely coming back again.\",\"Granite hills/Lac du Bonnet/Pinawa area is a beautiful and heavily forested part of the province, there's no shortage of hiking nearby as well as several boat launches.<br/>The cabin is well maintained, clean, air conditioned, and located close to a convenience store and boat launch. We brought our dog and had a great overall experience. <br/>The great trail is a short drive away, and there are numerous connecting hikes to enjoy the Canadian shield and views of the lake and Winnipeg River system. The old pinawa Dam makes for great pictures as well.\",\"This place was amazballz! If you sled, boat, fish, definitely a great place to be. Area is fun, and would recommend 100 times over. Cabin was very cozy. We miss it already.\",\"We just spent 9 nights at Shelly’s place to enjoy snowmobiling with family and friends on the beautiful trails in the area. Shelly’s Communication before and during our stay was prompt and kind. We were led to feel this was our home away from home. We were able to use the detached garage to store our snowmobiles which was appreciated since we had some -30 to -40 nights.  The place was clean, spacious, inviting and plenty of space, well stocked with necessities and linens/bedding/toiletries were plentiful. We appreciated that our dog was welcome.  We would absolutely book Shelly’s place again for a winter staycation!\",\"We rent a vacation home every year and this is by far the best one. Friendly owner, clean place, and absolutely pet-friendly. Comfy beds, fully equipped kitchen, and awesome patio furnitures. We really enjoyed our stay, and definitely recommend this place for your vacation.\",\"Very clean with everything you could want/need.  Fantastic communication and accommodation by Shelly!\",\"Beautiful cabin with a very relaxing setting. Everything was as promised. We highly recommend this rental!!\",\"Very comfortable, clean and well appointed home.

There was a terrible smell coming from the front portion of the unit for the entire stay. The neighbors were very loud at night which made it very difficult to sleep at night. Me and my girlfriend felt very unsafe not only because of the neighbors, but there was multiple occasions where police were called to the building as well and constant fire alarms. I believe these are issues that need to be brought to the customers attention before check in and I felt they weren’t transparent with these issues.\",\"Great place to stay, close to Square One.

Check in and check out was key transfer from George and wife with tour of house and garden. Super nice people.\",\"Very cozy home\",\"If you want to relax in green surroundings, it's ideal. Absolutely only 50 meters from lovely beach with rocks, but with sandals in a lovely place to swim.<br/>Only downside is a disturbance at night : barking dogs and motorcycles.\",\"A little paradise – the best Airbnb experience in Greece!<br/>We have stayed in many places in Greece, but nothing beats the experience with George and his wonderful wife! Their house is very special-a little oasis filled with charm, tranquility, and personality. We were greeted with a warmth and hospitality that you rarely experience. George and his wife are arguably the most welcoming and sweetest hosts we have met on our trip:) <br/>The garden is like taken out of an adventure-with free-range hens, cute rabbits, and scented fruit trees everywhere. You can pick fresh fcitrons and oranges right from the trees and enjoy them in the shade under a pergola, while the hens calmly step by. It's all so peaceful and authentic that you immediately feel at home.<br/>The house is neat, clean, and decorated with love for the details-nothing is missing. Here's a very special atmosphere that just makes you ever want to leave again.<br/>If you're looking for a real, Greek experience with heart and soul – then book here!\",\"George and his wife are nice people who come to pick you up at the church, and take you to the house. A beautiful old characteristic house with garden (including chickens and rabbits). Close to the sea with beautiful sunset (no beach).\",\"An excellent stay in this pleasant house, bordered by a very beautiful garden. By the sea, with shops nearby... perfect! Thank you for the very warm welcome\",\"We urgently needed a place to stay and the house host was very responsive. We felt like a grandma's in the cottage, it was fun, we had a great night's sleep, and in the morning we had a coffee in the backyard by the trees of orange and lemon, something great! Next to the sea, and it was very nice to walk and look for pebbles :) <br/>The hosts of the house are wonderful! Incredibly nice people with open hearts❤️ Other than that we got a  bag of oranges and lemons from their orchard \uD83C\uDF3B\",\"Mr. George was very helpful with the house and the check-in process. The house is nice with a beautiful garden and in a good location. We recommend it!\",\"We loved to visit this traditional Greek house. George and his wife were wonderful, very kind and helpful. Contact during our stay was perfect. The house is nearby a mini supermarket and bakery, and of course Patras. The only downside were a few dogs in the neighborhood that were sounding alarm during the night\",\"Nice house, great people.\",\"A beautiful little house. It personally brought us memories of a classic house in the village with the retro classic furnishings. Clean and with renovated bathroom. Courtyard for the kids and relax. Thank you.\",\"Exceptional people. The house is very comfortable and clean. We were absolutely delighted and definitely recommend it!!!!\",\"The hosts are indeed very friendly and kind, resposive and etc... I think this could be a good place for short stop-by (1-2) days. And what we think also is that it's not suitable for the winter, it's frieking cold, we stayed with the jackets all the time - there's a heater in one of the rooms and an air-conditioner in the other but they could not heat the whole place enough especially ifyou gonna stay for a day or two. The backyard seems indeed very nice for the summer, but we didn't use it unforetunately. Another drawback could be the parking (because of the old narrow greek streets), as we had to park nearby - not a problem for us but good to know by others so they could decide\",\"Very responsive host, spacious house next to the sea, we had a good night!\",\"For a group of 3 people, the stay was great.\",\"We spent two beautiful days here with the family. We were fantastic food in the evening thanks to the host's restaurant recommendation.\",\"What a fantastic place! A lovley typical greek house, with a lovely garden. George and his family was a terrific host, very friendly and kind. The kids got to help George feed the chickens, turkey an rabbits. The house was also really close to the sea, perfect to take a morning or night swim. George responeded fast to our proposals, and was easy to communicate with. A charming small village. Would absloutely recommend a stay here!\",\"The owners very very nice, really very friendly and welcoming. <br/>Beautiful house, backyard with very good space, quiet area and not far from the beach. Very close to the city of Patras (if you are by car of course) <br/>We got our money <br/>I will give a 5/5 to the owners really spectacular people.\",\"We stayed for one night and it was great. The house is about half an hour from the airport so it is very convenient.  George and his wife gave us a warm and pleasant welcome.\",\"Nice house with a patio at both the front and the back.<br/>We slept well, AC in the bedroom that worked well. We were only 2 people but the house had several bedrooms and plenty of room for more. It was close to the water for a swim, if you want an organized beach with sun loungers and umbrellas, there is not in the village., we drove to a beach called Aloha beach about 15 km from there that was nice <br/>We had good souvlaki at the village tavern.<br/>Close also to bakery and Minimarket<br/>Good value for money.\",\"George and Eugénia are very welcoming and full of good advice. I highly recommend this place and these people!\",\"Small house impassing for one night, very welcoming host, we had a nice stay.\",\"We had a wonderful stay at George's place.

Apartment felt very practical.<br/>We were not able to find plug for the sink or sponge/brush for washing dishes.<br/>Other than that it had everything we needed and well equipped.\",\"Excellent location, very easy to reach accommodation thanks to clear and detailed instructions. <br/>Very responsive host. <br/>The only downside was that the wifi didn't work and the cleanliness of the bathroom. For the rest, everything was perfect. The location is a real plus, everything is within walking distance! Be careful, you have to be in good shape because there are a lot of stairs! But charming corner and the studio has all the features. A big plus for the responsiveness of the hosts. I really recommend this place!\",\"Perfect space for a couple who want to feel the energy of living in Lisbon's most charming neighborhood. Having the experience of walking through the alleys, going up and down the stairs, taking a cable car, funicular, visiting the many overlooks and finally enjoying the vibration of nightlife in the various local restaurants. Spectacular!!!!\",\"Great stay in Lisbon!<br/>The apartment is perfectly located for visiting everything on foot. The neighborhood is very cute and the location is super quiet, no noise at night. We were able to sleep perfectly. <br/>The studio is small but cute and really functional so it was just perfect. <br/>If you want an apartment in a good location for visiting and quiet for sleeping at night, go for it!\",\"Very good stay. The accommodation is well located, in the historic district of Lisbon, in a small inner courtyard (quiet). Many nearby restaurants, pastelerias and shops.<br/>Flexible check-in was a plus compared to our arrival times, and the instructions left by the host beforehand were clear and helpful (with highly valuable recommendations on transport and catering).<br/>The accommodation is small but well furnished, ideal for a stay for 2 as we did, and very clean. The bedding was good quality.\",\"Small listing as advertised <br/>Super Clean<br/>The bed linen smelled like laundry which is very nice <br/>Adelaide and Hugo were very attentive to the messages sent <br/>Their explanation and advice were very helpful in finding the accommodation and making our stay fun and enjoyable <br/>I highly recommend this place for 2 people\",\"Top\",\"The flat is very similar to the pictures, the neighborhood is nice, but it is very hard to find the flat without a GPS.<br/>Communication with the host was easy and smooth.\",\"Wonderful stay! Great space for a short visit. Good communication and helpful host! Thank you very much!\",\"The host and team have excellent communication and a very timely response. I was allowed to check in when I arrived around 9, for which I'm grateful. The place is small but efficient and clean. Location is a little difficult to find just because it's in the oldest part of the city. Unfortunately, that particular area is very dirty. Be prepared to dodge dog poop. I don't know if there's anything host can do as a community member to improve the cleanliness of the surrounding area.\",\"Very good stay in this studio, perfectly matches the photos and very well equipped and clean. The only downside is the presence of a little humidity but which was no problem. We'll be happy to go back!\",\"Great directions to the place. Cute neighborhood and all we needed for my brother and I.\",\"Comfortable studio in the heart of the alamara. It can only be reached on foot but very easy to find and 5 minutes from transportation. The bathroom is not large but well enough! clean and bright. Great stay!\",\"Wonderful apartment in the heart of Alfama\",\"This place has a great location in the Alfama district, perfect for fully enjoying the charm of Lisbon. The apartment is comfortable and well suited for a short stay, such as a weekend.<br/>The only downside is that the owner didn't respond to my messages via email, which made the communication a little complicated. We didn't have access to the wifi network.\",\"The place was really great: very clean, well equipped and conveniently located. You can do anything on foot. The location is also perfect for those looking for calm. Only small tip: provide earplugs, because you sometimes hear people on the upper floors on the stairs. But other than that, everything was perfect. I would recommend it in a second!\",\"Accommodation good quality price. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Very quiet area within Alfama. Close to public transport. The house when you arrive and it has been closed all day you can see the humidity but when ventilating it resolves. Perfect for a couple. For those who have light sleep the garbage is something scandalous but it happens soon on 00.30 and does not last long, at least with the window open. The hosts are very friendly and quick to answer my questions. I would repeat it again.\"]</td><td>4.8</td><td>{\"seller_id\":\"222613293\",\"url\":\"https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/222613293\"}</td><td>Portugal</td><td>Portugal</td><td>38.7117</td><td>-9.1289</td><td>2</td><td>false</td><td>[\"Entire rental unit\",\"1 bed\",\"1 bath\"]</td><td>[{\"name\":\"Cleanliness\",\"value\":\"4.7\"},{\"name\":\"Accuracy\",\"value\":\"4.9\"},{\"name\":\"Check-in\",\"value\":\"4.9\"},{\"name\":\"Communication\",\"value\":\"4.9\"},{\"name\":\"Location\",\"value\":\"4.9\"},{\"name\":\"Value\",\"value\":\"4.7\"}]</td><td>[\"Check-in after 5:00 PM\",\"Checkout before 11:00 AM\",\"2 guests maximum\"]</td><td>[\"2 guests\",\"1 bedroom\",\"1 bed\",\"1 bath\"]</td><td>[{\"name\":\"Self check-in\",\"value\":\"Check yourself in with the lockbox.\"},{\"name\":\"Lots to do nearby\",\"value\":\"Guests say this area has plenty to explore.\"}]</td><td>[{\"name\":\"Bedroom\",\"value\":\"1 double bed\"}]</td><td>[{\"group_name\":\"Bathroom\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Hair dryer\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_HAIRDRYER\"},{\"name\":\"Shampoo\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_SHAMPOO\"},{\"name\":\"Shower gel\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_SOAP\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Bedroom and laundry\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Free washer – In unit\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_WASHER\"},{\"name\":\"Free dryer – In unit\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_DRYER\"},{\"name\":\"Essentials\",\"value\":\"Towels, bed sheets, soap, and toilet paper\"},{\"name\":\"Bed linens\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_BLANKETS\"},{\"name\":\"Iron\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_IRON\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Entertainment\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"32 inch HDTV\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_TV\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Heating and cooling\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"AC - split type ductless system\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_SNOWFLAKE\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Home safety\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Fire extinguisher\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_FIRE_EXTINGUISHER\"},{\"name\":\"First aid kit\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_FIRST_AID_KIT\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Internet and office\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Wifi\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_WI_FI\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Kitchen and dining\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Kitchen\",\"value\":\"Space where guests can cook their own meals\"},{\"name\":\"Refrigerator\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_REFRIGERATOR\"},{\"name\":\"Microwave\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_MICROWAVE\"},{\"name\":\"Cooking basics\",\"value\":\"Pots and pans, oil, salt and pepper\"},{\"name\":\"Dishes and silverware\",\"value\":\"Bowls, chopsticks, plates, cups, etc.\"},{\"name\":\"Induction stove\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_STOVE\"},{\"name\":\"Coffee maker\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_COFFEE_MAKER\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Services\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Self check-in\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_KEY\"},{\"name\":\"Lockbox\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_SAFE\"}]},{\"group_name\":\"Not included\",\"items\":[{\"name\":\"Exterior security cameras on property\",\"value\":\"SYSTEM_NO_SURVEILLANCE\"},{\"name\":\"Smoke alarm\",\"value\":\"There is no smoke alarm on the property.\"},{\"name\":\"Carbon monoxide alarm\",\"value\":\"Host has indicated no carbon monoxide detector is necessary.

         "[\"We had an amazing stay at this beautiful place in Broadbeach! The apartment was spotless, well-equipped, and exactly as described. The location was perfect — close to everything yet peaceful and relaxing. The hosts were incredibly friendly, responsive, and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.<br/>Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. We’d definitely love to come back again!\",\"Fantastic stay at Broadbeach, amazing location and the condo was fully equipped with very comfortable beds. The place was squeaky clean and the Tim Tams on arrival was a cute thought. They’d really thought of everything that you’d need during the stay and we couldn’t have wanted anything more. Thanks again, we will definitely stay again!\",\"Amazing location walking distance to prestine beach, restaurants, cafes and ice cream shops with Woolworths literally next door. The accommodation itself was modernly furnished with great amenities and super clean. The service provided by Broadbeach Luxury Stays from inquiry to check-in was second to none. highly recommended.\",\"A great compact, modern apartment with excellent facilities.  Main bedroom great size with views and sliding doors which allow good breeze to flow through.  2nd bedroom has no window but is a good size.  Bathroom is jack and jill style - comfy bath to relax in and plenty of space for toiletries.  Well equipped kitchenette and laundry.  Walkable to Pacific Fair and restaurants in Broadie.  An enjoyable stay.  Would stay again.\",\"Amazing stay. <br/>All boxes ticked. Cleanliness, location, communication and comfort. Enjoyed our stay.\",\"From the check in through to the departure everything was just beautiful. The apartment has everything you need and it’s lovely sitting outside on the balcony enjoying the weather. The hosts were very helpful and provided a personal check in. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.\",\"it is rare to enter a property and immediately feel a sense of warmth and  comfort. It is also not often to find a property that ends up being better than the pics. Karin was extremely welcoming and informative. <br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and all.our needs were provided for. <br/>The level of cleanliness is 5 star. We will certainly be returning.\",\"Great unit in the heart of Broadbeach. Kitchen facilities are handy. Located on level 6, room 608. Parking was in basement level 3. Cafe downstairs was very nice and convenient. <br/>It was fine for us but the main bedroom has a wall of frosted glass between the bathroom. No curtain so light at night lights up main bedroom. Would recommend a blind or curtain.\",\"Fantastic! Quite at night but still just a walk to everything\",\"Lovely decorated apartment that is very well stocked with all the essentials you need.<br/>Fantastic local\",\"The apartment was one of the best I have stayed in so clean beds were so comfortable they have thought of everything you would need it's a fantastic location for beach restaurants shopping had the best time thanks fir having us Cathy Alex  from New zealand\",\"We absolutely loved our four night stay. The check-in process with Karin was great and the unit itself was wonderful and in a terrific location. Could not recommend more highly.\",\"We were two colleagues, going to a conference at the conference centre. The location was great for this, being very walkable, with several cafes between the two. The beach was also a short walk away so this was a perfect location for us. The apartment has the bathroom in between the two bedrooms, so some bathroom door closure protocols had to be established between the two of us and it was fine. There is a big glass window between the bathroom and big bedroom, but the frosting on the glass reduces the view into the bathroom. There is one big bedroom with great views and one small bedroom without windows which can be dark. Cleanliness and functionality of everything was great. Would happily stay again.\",\"Highly recommend this apartment! Super comfortable space with lots of natural light! Great location 3 minute walk to the beach and host was responsive and met us for checkin. Would stay here again, thank you!\",\"Great place to stay highly recommend this property\",\"Great location, amazing hosts. Would stay again\",\"This is a lovely apartment to stay.  Close to everything, walk to beach and restaurants. Host lovely and friendly.  I will be back.\",\"Excellent accommodation, close to restaurants and beach\",\"Beautiful apartment! Amazing views! Felt at home. Definitely stay again if we're in the Gold Coast.\",\"Beautiful apartment, exactly at pictured. Location is great and the hosts were fantastic with their communication. Highly recommend staying here!\",\"Lovely clean, modern, well equipped apartment in a great location … couldn’t have asked for anything more! Thanks for making the apartment available on AirBnB.\",\"Awesome stay in Broadbeach. The place was central to everything. <br/>Apartment itself was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again\",\"Absolutely loved the apartment, the building and the location. We’ll definitely be back, hopefully for a longer stay next time!\",\"Love this place, right in the hub of Broadbeach and less road noise than same places in the area.

A major attraction in the area is the fully restored amazing and historic Port Welshpool Long Jetty...a must visit family friendly jetty with beautiful safe beach surrounds. You can be as busy as you wish or relaxed as you may need:) there are so many things to do and see for adults and kids alike including great fishing, lovely safe beaches as well as bike tracks or if you like to walk or hike there are so many beautiful unspoilt areas for all to enjoy all within easy reach of Melbourne. Come stay and enjoy at a price we have set so a break is affordable to all -all we ask is that you treat the house as your own and respect the rate we charge and in return please clean on departure. Many thanks!The house has beautiful wooden cathedral ceilings with delightful character. Recently fully renovated with a new kitchen, bathroom and furnishings. A reverse cycle air conditioner for summer and winter comfort and great heating for those cosy winter nights and there is also a wood heater (so sorry wood not provided now as it would weirdly \"disappear\" when we did) There is a large lounge / open living plan with new kitchen with absolutely everything you will need along with microwave, ceramic cooktop,  Aldi Coffee maker and lots of bench space and walk in pantry. There is a 50” Ultra HD TV along with the Foxtel Entertainment Package which includes 9 Sports Channels for the boys (including Fox Sports) plus STAN for your enjoyment ...and FREE WIFITwo good size bedrooms one with a comfy queen bed (including 37\" TV in the main bedroom) and the other with a double bed and a single so comfortably sleeps 5.Along 2 full sides of the house is a delightful covered verandah that gets lots of sun and shade (not to mention the peaceful outlook lovely to view the native birds and a lovely area to have breakie or have a drink or BBQ in the eve- there is a gas BBQ available. We have several board games to play which we often do!! If you have a boat there is lots of room on the large easily accessible corner block with the store (great fish and chips), the beach and jetty just a few minutes walk away. – So bring the kids fishing rods!NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen, towels and toiletries etc (everything else is there incl shampoo body wash, hand soaps, toilet rolls etc) and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)PETS: Also please note (and sorry) we do not allow pets after three VERY bad experiences. We used to welcome the family pet as we have animals ourselves, but many dollars later with repairs we have had to make due to irresponsible people we have now changed our policy - apologies to all the responsible pet owners out there.ATTRACTIONS IN THE AREA (and Things to do just to name a few)The brand new and famous (now totally restored) Port Welshpool Long JettyA lovely kid’s safe beachWhale Watching cruises leave from Port Welshpool (seasonal)Wilsons PromAgnes FallsToora Wind FarmTarra Bulga National Park – Wow!Port Albert (Historic Fishing Village)Lovely Cafes in Toora, Foster and YarramGreat Fishing and Swimming Wildlife galoreLovely Walkways, bike tracks and Tramping optionsHistoric Museums WELCOME TO PORT WELSHPOOL -VICTORIAS SECRET A LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVENThe Port and surrounds Port Welshpool is a lovely drive of about 90 minutes from Cranbourne once you hit the Sth Gippsland Highway and is in an undiscovered \"peaceful paradise\" just a short drive from beautiful and unspoilt Wilsons Prom. We own our lovely \"home away from home\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \"The Port\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.Guest accessEntire houseOther things to noteNOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \"relaxees\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)",

         "[\"It’s a nice peaceful place to get away from busy city life. Great location, a walking distance to the beach and the local pub. Short drive to Toora where  we had really nice coffee and thick shakes at The Windmill Cafe with so friendly staff. <br/>Beautiful scenery around Foster.<br/>The house warm, cosy  and comfortable which feel like home.<br/> Thanks Kerry Jo and Ezra, we definitely come back next time.<br/>Warm regards,<br/>Loan\",\"This home and area was so beautiful, was completely in awe of everything. The hosts were super nice and had a clear manual of everything you may need and the home is just the cutest most cozy place and you can really tell how beautiful these people are by this house. We drove to Wilson’s prom and it was incredible, felt like I was in another country, will definitely be coming back!!\",\"The hosts were very happy to help with anything before, during and afterwards in constant communication. The house exceeded our expectations, was fully functional felt like home away from home. Would definitely like to come back again soon for another visit. Thank you so much guy we really appreciate your hospitality!!\uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFC\uD83D\uDE00\uD83D\uDE05\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFC\",\"What a gem!!! \uD83D\uDC8E <br/>Perfect base to explore The Prom and Tara Bulga National Park (which we would have missed if this wasn’t included in the house description). Home was a perfect home away from home. Had absolutely everything we could possibly need. <br/>The hosts opting to have guests byo linen and self clean made it affordable for us. It was so clean and tidy (more so than some other places we’ve stayed at) <br/>Thank you Kerry Jo and Ezra. We will be recommending this place to our friends and family.\",\"We had a very pleasant weekend stay. We had a great time driving around the area. The house is cool and relaxing. I like the interior, complete stuff and close to the pier. Easy to communicate with the host.\",\"Had the best weekend here in port welshpool!

The WIFI was brilliant in this regional area to my surprise too. It was all I hoped for being quiet  and secluded with decking surrounded by greenery. Perfect location to adventure out to Wilson's Prom, Agnes Falls and the Tarra-Bulga National Park. Can't stress enough...Extremely good value reduced to simply treat their house like you would your own (and we stayed in high holiday season when caravan parks were costly). We had a lovely intimate family Christmas escape from the city to the fresh air and quiet peaceful surrounds. Check out the general store for some great fish and chips too! Kerry, Jo and Ezra are fabulous hosts responding quickly (even over Christmas) to any questions and providing a wealth of information on the area which is also listed in a binder on arrival. Thankyou for a wonderful Christmas stay guys! Will be back again and again.\",\"Clean & tidy place with good ammenities, full kitchen equipment, comfortable sofa & bed, fits 4-5 people with a good price.<br/>Host is very friendly and easy going, we mentioned that we arrived late (Friday night after work) on the check in day - they offered to stay another night for free if we could extend our trip but unfortunately we couldn’t, then we had late check out around 2pm instead.<br/>Recommended \uD83D\uDC4C\uD83C\uDFFC\",\"Truly a home away from home with the most well-equipped kitchen.  Kerry, Jo And Ezra were very friendly and gave very clear instructions before our stay. There is also a lovely waterfall in 15 mins drive, which is perfect for an early morning walk. The best budget-friendly choice! :)\",\"Was the perfect accommodation for a trip down to Wilsons Prom! Very spacious yet very home-y, fit for a group of friends or family. Effective communication from the hosts as well. Would definitely come back.\",\"We really enjoyed our stay at Kerry Jo and Ezra's place.<br/>Very comfortable and clean home with lots of outdoor space.<br/>Thanks for your friendly communication and for being so helpful.<br/>We'd love to stay again.\",\"We spent 4 fabolous days in port whelspool away from home but it actually felt to be home anyways. house was very good, in a quite area and nothing was missing.  thanks for the great service<br/>Luca and Linda\",\"Great spot if you own a boat or plan to do one of the trips that leave port Welshpool. Really good setup, large kitchen, great workspace. Fire is always a bonus, foxtel was a real novelty, watched a few Ghostbusters gems. House is really well built we had crazy winds when we visited and the house barely creaked or whistled, it felt really secure. Love the “clean it yourself” vibes it’s a great idea. Thanks for having us.\",\"Very positive to communicate, friendly and have every thing ready in the room, recommended\",\"quaint little cottage with everything you need for a stay close to some great local attractions\",\"Lovely and peaceful. The accomadation was justas described,   clean and tidy<br/>Not alot to do in the area if u have kids. <br/>Great for walks,  swimming , fishing and all in all nature and water activities which is what I wanted.<br/>Enjoyed my stay feel very relaxed now\",\"We stayed for two nights with three friends and had a great time.

We own our lovely \\\"home away from home\\\" (well the bank does) and instead of tenanting it we decided to share our little paradise with like minded people who will enjoy this lovely area as much as we do. \\\"The Port\\\" is a very historic part of Victoria and has an all weather/ all tide boat ramp (1 minute drive from the house) with great fishing from the jetty or the wharf and also very safe swimming and paddling from the lovely sandy beach. The Port is also the entrance to the Prom either by boat or by a short drive so you can explore at will or just relax and there are also MANY other beautiful attractions in the area. There is a great General Store (great takeaway food options) which has all your needs or supermarkets 20 or so minutes away in Foster or Yarram. There is also a Foodworks in Toora (10 minutes away). There are launderettes in Foster and Yarram also should you need them.Fishing is hugely popular in the area. Wilsons Promontory National Park and the islands of Corner Inlet can be reached by launch or sailboat from the port. There is a launching ramp and boats can be hired locally. Hog deer, an endangered species in their native Asia, have been introduced into a State game reserve on Snake Island, in order to bolster their numbers. The Port Welshpool Museum (opposite the house) features marine displays and an unusual assortment of maritime curios. The house, built in 1881, was one of the first substantial dwellings to be constructed at Port Welshpool. The builder, J. Avery, had to walk 21 miles from Port Albert every Monday, and returned by foot each weekend. It is thought to be one of the oldest buildings in the shire of South Gippsland. On the lawn is the fishing boat, the Janet Isles, which was used by the house's owners, the Smith family, for several generations. Barry Beach, a few kilometers west, is a supply base for the oil rigs of Bass Strait. Steel platforms are constructed here and towed into the strait, where piles are driven through the hollow legs and a deck is welded on. An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. The area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. Harold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter's Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 The township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.\"},{\"title\":\"Guest access\",\"value\":\"Entire house\"},{\"title\":\"Other things to note\",\"value\":\"NOTE: All you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next \\\"relaxees\\\" we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)\"}]",

An observation area, overlooking the terminal, has been organised. \n<br>\n<br>\nThe area was reputedly named after jack-of-all-trades, John Baragwanath, who owned land at the mouth of the Agnes River. Skilled at ironwork, photography, and surveying, he manufactured his own camera and telescope and assisted the locals in the guises of an informal doctor, a legal counselor, and a bush dentist - always carrying a set of forceps with which to yank out troublesome teeth. \n<br>\nHarold Lasseter - the man who made and prompted numerous expeditions to central Australia by claiming that a mother lode of gold, known as Lasseter&apos;s Reef, was there to be mined - lived in the area for his last thirty years. He died returning from one of his own trips in about 1931 \n<br>\n<br>\nThe township of Welshpool, a few kilometers to the north, relies upon the dairy and wool industries. 9 km north-west of Welshpool you can visit one of the highest waterfalls in Victoria at the Agnes Falls Reserve, where the river plunges 60 m over the gorge. The damming of the river above the falls ensures the water supply Welshpool and other local towns. Walking tracks, picnic and barbecue facilities are available. To get there, head west along the highway and turn off at Slades Hill Road, near the school. The route is signposted. Return via Toora for maximum scenic value.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"_g5uevq\">Guest access</span>\n<br>\nEntire house\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"_g5uevq\">Other things to note</span>\n<br>\nNOTE: \n<br>\nAll you will need is your own Linen and towels etc and due to the budget rates in a lovely holiday home you are asked to PLEASE CLEAN ON DEPARTURE for the next &quot;relaxees&quot; we know those that book will... as we trust people appreciate the price we offer to make it affordable for all to stay..THANKS HEAPS :)\n</span>\n",

         "Cuba apartment will provide you an excellent location right in the heart of Brasov Old Town, 50m from the Black Church. In the same time, it is a quiet place with an amazing view of the forest behind the city walls towards the White Tower.The place is located in one of the iconic historical buildings in Brasov. It was built in the 18th Century on the old City walls(you can still see the old city wall from the window) and the building was used as a the main eye hospital in Transilvania.The spaceThe apartment was designed in a way that it keeps some of its' older vibe, but in the same time provide its' guests with the highest level of comfort possible.Since the ceilings are so high, we took advantage of this for the first bedroom where we designed a whole structure so that we can have the bed on an upper level, thus taking advantage of the space below where we set up a small desk and some storage spaces. We also welcome you to the round table, which is a perfect place to have some fun with your family or friends. This space also works as a living room since it's exactly above the entrance of the apartment in a common accessed area For the other bedroom, given the size of the room, we went for large pieces of furniture, trying also to keep a more vintage aspect to it and not overcrowd the room.  You will immediately notice the old wood stove in the corner which towers and looks over the whole room from the corner.The kitchen and the bathroom are both fully equipped for any of your needs, and we also wanted to make sure that both of them have something special to offer to our guests from a design perspective. You will notice the old wood stove in the bathroom as it is has been transformed to encompass the sink area.Guest accessFor parking you have one available 100 meters away. Given the central location I highly recommend you ditch the car and explore the city by foot. There is also a bus station close by to explore other parts of the city, and if you enjoy skiing during winter, or just want to have a stroll, the bus station towards Poiana Brasov is only 500 meters away.",

         "[\"Lovely apartment, clean and suited a family of four. Our kids are 9 and 11 and enjoyed the mezzanine bed. Very tastefully decorated and close to main square in Brasov.\",\"We arrive from the airport and it was about 15 minutes walk. Sobway/metro was just around the corner. had a few restaurants within walking distance. overall good\",\"The Apartment was advertised as a 2 bedrooms apartment. In reality  our 2 grownup kids had to crawl to the matress up in the gallery/attic. We  filled our kids age in the filling forms. It was clear that our children are grownups. Yet the apartment was promoted as a 2 bedrooms apartment suitable for 4 persons. The second room was not a bedroom, but rather a dinning room with a mattress  at the attic. Not suitable for adult grownup children. Our children didn't sleep well in a suitable bed and it ruined all our stay. We think it would be appropriate to be truthfull with the advertisement and discription of the apartment. Not suitable for a familly with big children.\",\"Pros: absolutely stunning apartment, fantastic decorations, very clean, comfortable beds, large TV, close to main square (2 min walk), easy access, friendly staff, responsive owner, large bathroom<br/>Cons: thin walls and next door Airbnb has a piano which guests played at 1am, second bedroom on mezzanine above main front door not that private and could get noise from squeaky floors\",\"I stayed here for three days and absolutely loved it. The place is wonderful—cozy, intimate, beautifully designed, and very practical. It has a special charm, with heritage pieces that give it a unique and refined atmosphere. It’s the kind of place you can’t wait to return to.<br/>During my stay, I had three days of work and found the space very conducive to productivity. Unfortunately, on the first day, there was a lot of noise from a team of workers nearby, which disrupted my focus. However, the hosts were incredibly attentive and welcoming. As soon as I mentioned the issue, they promptly took care of it, and from the second day onwards, it was perfectly quiet.<br/>I’m very grateful for their hospitality and care and would definitely come back again for both work and leisure. A truly special place!\",\"So beautiful my wife asked how do we buy this place as soon as we walked in. Hard with parking and a family though as summer in Brasov is busy and not always lots of parking. But the place itself is amazing.  My son loved sleeping in the loft bed which was an awesome experience\",\"We had an amazing stay in this beautiful apartment. The bedroom is stunning. Right in the centre of town. Highly recommend.\",\"An absolutely beautiful flat, nicer than the photos in the listing. Very comfortable, set back from the street and very quiet with a lovely view of trees.\",\"Great apartment in a great location with a gorgeous kitchen and main bedroom.\",\"Really beautiful place! We had a great time. It is in an ideal location\",\"Andreis Flat is just beautiful. We really felt like home and would for sure come again!\",\"Clean spacious place. Close to everything!\",\"Amazing stay, central location and nice restaurants.\",\"Great place…perfect location\",\"I recommend it.\",\"Everything went great! :)\",\"The apartment is as shown in the pictures! Very spacious, tidy and tastefully decorated. Outstanding location. Andrei very friendly and antento. Highly recommended! :)\",\"What a great accommodation! It is right next to the old square and the master bedroom has a gorgeous view of the White Tower and a lush green backyard full of cherry trees. The master is like a bedroom for royalty. Large and spacious to the extreme. The second bedroom is more of a platform bed, rather than a room itself. The kitchen has the basic necessities for morning coffee and scrambled eggs\uD83D\uDE0A. There are many great restaurants within a short walking distance. Andrei was super responsive and flexible with our checkin time. I highly recommend this Airbnb\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB\",\"Fantastic two night stay at Cuba apartment. Beautifully decorated. Spotlessly clean. Warm and cozy despite the snow outside . Great views from the windows of the Brasov sign and white tower. Very responsive hosts . <br/>The perfect location to stay  in beautiful Brasov square.  I highly recommend and will definitely return to Brasov and stay here again .\",\"This is a wonderful spacious apartment, beautifully furnished, quite location, super clean and airy, in the heart of Brasov. Andrei is a gem! He was  incredibly helpful, kind, and attentive to our needs.<br/>The weather wasn't the greatest but Andrei's place made this trip one to remember.<br/>Thank you ever so much, Andrei!<br/>Looking forward to visiting again some time soon!\",\"We are Romanians living abroad, returning to our country for vacations as often as we can. Brasov and the surrounding areas are some of our favourite places to be. <br/>We tried a good few places in Brasov, but this one is hands down the best of them all! <br/>I love how they carefully saved the architecture of the building, the old fireplaces with museum worthy features and the wooden floors. <br/>You can see that’s someone is taking great care of this place. <br/>Highly recommended!!!\",\"I travelled for 3 weeks across Netherlands, Austria and Romania and this was by far the best place we stayed at. Well designed, lots of space, high ceilings, big bathroom space, everything was great. Even the view from the window while it snowed was magical. While Andrei helped us on chat, we met one of the hosts in person - Toni and had some great conversations. Toni set us up with a great guide/host who took us around all the castles. Overall an amazing experience and a great space and right next to the town square.\",\"The apartment is right in the heart of the old town center. Everything you would want to visit or see is in walking distance. <br/>From the bedroom you have a great view of the White Tower. From the living room you can see the top of the Tampa mountain with the BRASOV sign, over the rooftops.  <br/>The kitchen is top modern and the bathroom is huge. The bedroom is enormous. Everything looks exactly as in the pictures.\",\"We rented this space for the 4 of us. We got there and we were so impressed by the interior design, everything is newly renovated, a mix of modern but with rustic colours, well thought. Also the romanian traditional heaters (soba) were kept in, so impressed and appreciated. <br/>The beds are comfortable. The big bedroom is really huge, we loved it! <br/>The location is best you can get, right in the heart of the city. <br/>Highly recommend this! We can't wait to return back again!\"]",

         "[\"We truly enjoyed staying here and wished we could stay even longer. Michalis greeted us and shared recommendations for the best restaurants, beaches, etc on Paros and Antiparos which was super helpful! The house is only 10 minute walk from the village which gave us privacy and amazing views. The house is well equipped and clean. The back terrace was our favorite place to hang out in the evenings while watching the sunset.\",\"Absolutely loved our stay! Spacious and very clean, one room is completely separate which was great for the couples to have their own areas and the amenities were perfect! Great for families or couples!\",\"We had a great time at Michalis's place, very welcoming host and available anytime. The place was in pristine condition with all the necessary amenities. A breathtaking sea view in the middle of nature . We highly recommend your place to stay. No negative points.\",\"Wounderful stay. Amazing house with a lot of space and everything you need to unwind and just relax! Very friendly and welcoming host. Highly recommended!\",\"Nice people <br/>Helpful <br/>Slightly out of the way however nice privacy \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\",\"Perfect accommodation, spacious and comfortable, with a wonderful terrace for after-dinner drinks. Everything was great\",\"We felt at home. Michalis and his wife were always available to help us, very responsive but most of all very very sweet! The house was beautiful and clean and has a breathtaking view. They left water, wine, local olive oil and anything we could need for the beach as well. So many nice touches. We were a group of friends and I hope to take my family here one day. Thank you both!\",\"Very good hosting by Michalis, full of good advice. Perfect house. Very nice place.\",\"Beautiful home, breathtaking views, 5-10 min walk to Aliki, its beautiful beaches and delicious waterfront restaurants. A place we highly recommend, much nicer than the more touristy towns of Parikia or Naoussa. Very comfortable bedding, very well-equipped kitchen, impeccable cleanliness, beach chairs and umbrella very much appreciated. And Michalis is very available, kind, enthusiastic, generous with his time and information. Is there any better compliment?<br/>Thanks for everything.\",\"Everything was perfect, the house is very clean and beautiful, with a nice area in front of the house that has a stunning view on the sea. Michelis and his wife are very nice hosts, trying to make everything they can to make you enjoy your stay. Definitely a place I recomand !\",\"The villa fits comfortably the needs of 6 adults.The place is quiet and the seaview as well as sunset view are superb.The cleanliness of the villa and the kindness of the host are both strong arguments to recommend the villa.\",\"Great stay, the house is superb and we were able to enjoy the outdoors and the garden.<br/>Our host was very nice and available. I would recommend this place, close to the center and easy to access. Thank you\",\"This is exactly what all Airbnb experiences should be like. The perfect stay in a dream villa. The warm host Michalis took care of every need and surprised us along the way. The villa is very spacious with amazing views. It is impeccably clean, and the terrace is a gorgeous place to spend your evening with a Greek wine overlooking the Aegean. I have stayed in villas around the world and I don't have a single piece of feedback - I can only recommend it to whoever reads this message.\",\"We visited Villa Theros in August. The house is even better than the photos. It is brand new. It is decorated with taste and character. It is fully equipped and has a great BBQ spot. The verandas are amazing with a great view. The garden is very well maintained. Our daughter loved collecting figs from the trees. We really appreciated that the surrounding area was peaceful. The owners were great and welcoming. Communication before arrival was really good and precise. So sad we couldn't stay longer! We will definitely go back again!\",\"An Airbnb can not get better in our opinion. If we were ever to own one we would model it after what Michalis and his wife have created. It was perfection for us. Loved the location and the peace and quiet. Yet it is only a short walk to shops and restaurants. What a delightful find... it was our favorite place in Greece.\",\"Michalis’ villa exceeded our expectations in every way. He’s house was so well appointed thought out and tastefully designed with everything we needed in the kitchen, bathrooms and bedrooms . There is an amazing outdoor kitchen and gorgeous back deck with the most amazing sunsets and views . There was also a  fruit and vegetable garden we could pick from to add to our breakfasts and dinners. Every moment in the day was tranquil and picturesque with unobstructed views of the surrounding hills and oceans.<br/>Michalis was a kind and generous host and supplied us everything we could need . He had  lists, maps and tours all ready for us. If you are thinking about coming to Paros please consider staying at Michalis Villa , PARADISE !!!\",\"We stayed at Villa Theros as a group of six for nine days in September. <br/>I cannot reccommend it enough. The accommodation is spacious, tasteful, equipped with everything you could possibly need and it is brand new. <br/>It is in a peaceful yet convenient location about a 5 - 10 minute walk from the local village and beaches. The views over the surrounding are and sea are amazing. Michalis and Vaso were so friendly, fantastic hosts and seriously went above and beyond to ensure our experience was the best possible. Their advice on where to explore on the island was also invaluable. <br/>Overall, a fantastic experience and would not hesitate to return.\",\"5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH for this home.   You will love it, no question.  It is wonderfully renovated, exquisitely decorated, generously hosted, thoroughly supplied, and strategically located.  It is quiet and relaxing, perfect inside/out, and offers glorious views of country, sea, and town.    You will adore this home, we can guarantee it.  Our credentials to review are bolstered by at least 100 previous rental experiences in countries around the world.  This home brought together the best of all of those experiences, and none of the bad.  Many places we have stayed before have had lovely views, but poor renovation or equipping.  That was not the case here, it is the full package and leaves absolutely nothing to be desired.   The quality of the renovation is impeccable, carefully considered, and obviously the fruit of professional architects and interior designers.  That is only the beginning.  The furnishing and decoration are attractive, subtle, and practical.   The kitchen is a gift to travelers like us that have spent too much time in other rentals looking for sharp knives, cutting boards, oil/salts, or other simple and obvious things.  The hosts have handled the basic, and gone above and beyond to a degree that made us feel perfectly at home, and their concern and thoroughness was truly amazing.    As for the hosts, Michalis and Vaso are extremely kind, generous, friendly, and warm.  The home-made olive oil, jams, and freshly picked grapes and figs were delicious.   5 Stars is not enough.  This is the Greek Home You have always wanted.\",\"We were 4 adults and stayed in Villa Theros during May. We were really happy with our choice, the house is trully amazing. <br/>It is very clean and beautiful, the decoration is simple and tasteful and it is equipped with all things necessary. The balconies are large with a relaxing sea view. We really loved the fact that it is quiet and it has a large garden with trees and flowers. To our view the location is ideal because it is away from the everyday business of the town yet close enough to easily walk to the nearby beaches and the restaurants. The owners made us feel welcome and they were very kind and discreet. Overall we definitely recommend it and we will try to come back for a longer stay next time! <br/>Ευχαριστούμε πολύ για τη φιλοξενία!!\",\"The Villa is newly refurbished with all modern comforts, very clean and the owner is wonderfully helpful and quick in reply to any question.\",\"We had a great holiday at Villa Theros. Beautiful house and very comfortable because in addition to being in a lovely location, the furnishings and attention to detail  have made our stay super pleasant. Excellent cleaning and the presence of many accessories both in the kitchen and extra such as deckchairs and umbrellas to take to the beach.  And what about the owners who stay in the house next door: a mix of kindness, availability and friendliness.<br/>Super recommended !!! We will definitely be back!\",\"The house is perfectly as described: new, very well equipped and very comfortable. Michalis and his wife's welcome was exceptional, punctuated by small touches throughout our stay. They were perfect hosts, with great kindness, shared by many Greeks. Villa Theros is highly recommendable!\"]",

         "[\"This is the perfect location for Peniscola. Walkable to everything including the castle, restaurants and grocery.  Ana was the best host even meeting us on the street and directing us to parking and our apartment.  She also provided great dining recommendations! The apartment was perfect. Honestly even better in person than even the photos!  views of the beach and castle were perfect. Our only negative is we didn't stay long enough!\",\"We had a great time. Ana and her husband were very good hosts. We went with a girl of almost 4 years, and it was great, the beach right next door, restaurants, the promenade for afternoon walks... The apartment was very good, with all the amenities we were looking for. Everything was wonderful! I would recommend it without hesitation. Thanks guys, thanks to both of you!\",\"The apartment is very comfortable and very well located.<br/>Highly recommended, we'll definitely be back\",\"Very nice accommodation located facing the sea, very good bedding. A perfect welcome, Ana is very nice and gave us all the information we needed.\",\"Amazing location, the place is nicer then the pictures. The sea is right in front of the building, the host Ana was amazing. You are walks away from the castle. Highly recommend. <br/>Diana\",\"Fantastic apartment with excellent location, renovated and with all the services available (parking, wifi, linens, towels, toiletries, hairdryer, iron, kitchenware, products for the first days such as oil, vinegar, salt, sugar, dishwasher tablets……). Very complete kit. <br/>The views from the spectacular terrace, where you can eat four people perfectly. Even the views from the living-dining room are breathtaking. <br/>Air conditioning in the living room and heaters for the bedrooms. Located 5 minutes walk from the village and beachfront. <br/>Ana is very attentive and responding very quickly in communications with them. Excellent host, thank you very much Ana. <br/>PD. If there was a hammock on the terrace any would not leave the apartment :-)\",\"Ana is very attentive. Apartment very well located and in perfect condition\",\"We loved Ana’s place!  Ana met us at her place and helped us park and get to the unit.  We had a lovely nights sleep and woke up to enjoy the terrace with a view of the castle.  Many thanks!\",\"wonderful flat with and Ana was really helpful and friendly\",\"Great apartment! Great location! Ana is an extraordinary host! Thank you very much!\",\"advised! Ana its super nice and helpfull and the apartment is great\",\"The place was even better than on photos. Extra clean and cozy apartment. The location is great - 30 seconds from the beach, couple of minutes walking to the restaurant zone, but still pretty quiete to have a great family holidays. Private territory. The inside parking slot is Enough for the big car, what is not usual to seaside Spain :-)<br/>Super owner, with a great understanding of English language. <br/>Totally recommend!\",\"We were so pleased to have the opportunity to stay at Anas air b n n, it met our expectations by far … everything was as described… Ana was a great host and we would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Peniscola …. Stay here you won’t be disappointed and Ana really can’t do enough to help and support you during your stay ….

Don’t delay book today ….\",\"We were very comfortable, the place was very quiet, Ana was very friendly and at all times helped us with what we needed. It's a highly recommended house.

The beautiful, spacious and spotless apartment. Definitely a place to stay again. Thank you very much Ana!\",\"The location of Ana's apartment is unbeatable, just steps from the beach and historic downtown. Also, Ana is a very welcoming host and willing to help. 100% recommended!\",\"We stayed at Ana's place for our last night of 19 days of traveling through Spain and  wished we could have stayed longer! The weather was not great with a record-breaking DANA in Spain, but the rain broke for just enough time to walk up to the castle and see the beach. Ana was beyond kind and caring, especially in light of the DANA which had caused significant flooding in the Valencian region. She reached out ahead of time to be sure we were safe and offered to release us of our booking if we felt unsafe with traveling and cared enough to be sure we made it safely to the airport after leaving. The apartment was perfect! We especially loved the fully equipped kitchen, balconies, and having the garage right below the building to load/unload our luggage in bad weather. I highly recommend Ana's place! I wanted to give her a big hug for her kindness in a stressful time.\",\"A great well equipped apartment right next to the beach, will definitely stay again in the future.\",\"Very nice apartment, tastefully renovated, with sea views that you don't get tired of,  and partial views of Peniscola Castle from the balcony. Very clean, comfortable bedding. Within a few minutes walk, many restaurants, a supermarket, and the old town. Ana was very hospitable and friendly.\",\"very nice clean comfortable a place to recommend\",\"perfect location,the place super comfortable,very spacious and its main terrace we loved it.<br/>The place is very clean and with everything you could need.<br/>Communication with Ana was quick and very helpful.<br/>I highly recommend it.\"]",

         "[\"We stayed at Eva's place for 5 days. I was remotely working during that time and we are 2 people. Since we had already explored the island we had returned our car after reaching here.<br/>Pros:<br/>- The apartment is big so you need a large space that is useful.<br/>- The building has some good history and it really feels nice.<br/>- The location is great. It is right in the center of everything and also reachable by car (which isn't true for many other places)<br/>- Airbnb wise everything was available and comfortable. Christina is a great person and she was very responsive and helped us checkin and even gave us tips.<br/>Cons:<br/>There were some minor things you might want to weight if relevant:<br/>- The wifi is 5mbps so it might not work great if you are working remotely.<br/>- Because the facade is historic the apartment isn't very well lit from sunlight if that's preference for you.\",\"Kristina was very friendly. She reached out proactively and made sure our check was smooth. We had a full platter of fruits, home made jam, liquor and cookies waiting on us, which was as pleasant surprise!<br/>The place is right beside the harbor and all the shops, restaurants in old town. Great location and still quiet. The terrace is a great place to have coffee in the morning. Loved our stay!! Thanks Kristina!!\",\"We loved this apartment and its location right in the old town, steps from the Venetian port.<br/>It’s a peaceful oasis in the busy area: very quiet inside, Air conditioning, comfortable beds, 3 full bathrooms and large living areas. Nice rooftop with table, chairs, and lounge chairs. Clothes washer is a really nice plus, laundry soap is provided.<br/>Christina is very responsive, gave us a map and recommended restaurants, and left us a welcome gift. When we asked, she brought us a second set of keys which was helpful.<br/>The only possible negative is the stairs if you have mobility issues.<br/>Xania is delightful. We would definitely stay here again.\",\"Perfect place. Walking distance to the port with all restaurants and shops. Great place for a small family of 5-6. The only request is to change the TV to smart TV so we can share the smart phone screen and watch Netflix. Other than that everyone was perfect.\",\"Location was wonderful as far as walkable to many restaurants and shops. The home is clean and the AC works great. Has nice kitchen area however we never did cook. <br/>Only Con:  noise levels. The first bedroom we could hear our neighbors who were very loud the first 2 nights until they left. The bathroom door needs to be shut as sounds through the vents from outside restaurant and bar comes through. The upstairs bedroom my brother and his wife had and said they could hear the music from the bar if you are a light sleeper.\",\"We had an amazing time in Crete at this Airbnb! The home was beautiful and very clean and in an amazing location. The host was very friendly and if I were to ever go back to Chania I would definitely choose this place to stay!\",\"Beautiful apartment in the perfect location of old town. Highly recommend. Very accommodating host, especially with our 9 month old.\",\"We had an excellent stay - great location, very private and clean. The terrace was lovely. Would definitely stay again!\",\"Eva was a great host and easy to communicate with. Her home was clean and in a great location.\",\"Location location location!! Super comfy accommodation in an amazing location. Can’t wait to visit again!!!\",\"Fantastic stay! The room was clean, spacious, and well-decorated. Great amenities and convenient location. Highly recommend!\",\"Had a lovely stay in this great cosy Airbnb. The location is super convenient next to a lively street with plenty to see and eat. Highly recommend this spot!\",\"The house is in a great location to explore Chania. We were able to walk easily to the harbor and many restaurants. The house was clean, supplied all the necessities. Christina arranged transport from and to the airport and was at the house to greet us   <br/>She responded very quickly to our questions during our stay. There are a lot of stairs in the house so be aware of that. Everything is in perfect condition but the rooms are small. We enjoyed our stay very much!\",\"When we first checked in, we could not believe this was our rental. It was so modern and luxurious - four stories! Three bathrooms! A Private suite and terrace!! Plus you could not beat the location: we easily found parking after our day trips to the Western beaches and at night we walked short distances to restaurants and shops - plus there is an incredible beer bar two doors down (just look for the Chimay sign!). We only stayed for two nights but would have happily stayed several more!\",\"This place is incredible! Inside a historic building with a touch of modern. In the heart of old town. You’re literally in the middle of all of it. Additionally the beach is a short 5 minute walk. <br/>Christina made check in and out a breeze and if we had any questions she was there to help. <br/>The only negative thing I have to say is that I wished our stay was much longer. Next time we will be staying at least a week. <br/>We already miss Chania.\",\"Beautiful place, we enjoyed our time there\",\"A very nice place in a very good location\",\"We really enjoyed our stay at this recently-renovated building in the historic district of town. The space was tight but very well appointed with a full kitchen, dining area, living room and rooftop deck. The best feature of this unit is the perfect location. Tucked just a touch back from the harbor, with its myriad of dining options, sailing, postcard sunsets, and entertainment. Very walkable and easy in/out. Beds were comfortable and AC worked very well. There is a small grocery/bodega right around the corner with morning coffee and pastries. Evenings were quiet despite being near the entertainment district. We would recommend this place.\",\"The Neoria Houses in Chania were fantastic.  Could not have been more centrally located, and beautifully designed with a mix of old and new.  We were welcomed with warm hospitality and wonderful advice and offers of help.  We would go back anytime.\",\"Location is the best thing about this space! Quiet despite the bustling area. Very chic decor. Lovely space!! <br/>Beds, pillows, and top blankets could’ve been more comfortable. That’s the only downside!!\",\"Incredible location, space and views!  <br/>The only issue we had was finding the location upon check in- we rented a car and gps maps navigated us to the wrong spot with the address provided (it showed it across the street from the actual location).  Pro tip: gps navigate to “The Chop Street Food, Chania” and park in the tiny parking lot immediately following the The Chop- this is where our host met us and the best place to unload the vehicle.  Parking was extremely difficult to find nearby so we ended up parking a ways away and leaving there car there our entire stay lol.  <br/>Besides that, we absolutely loved everything about our stay!  10/10 recommended stay.\",\"Enjoyed our stay in Chania. Comfortable accommodations with parking nearby. Really can’t beat the location near the port / old town and everything you’ll want to see plus host provided list of recommended restaurants. Great home base for your time in Chania.\",\"Great location and beautiful home! The host was very accommodating and helpful. We walked easily to all of the parts of town we wanted to visit and were very comfortable.\",\"A wonderful apartment with a great private balcony. Very walkable. Hosts were wonderful and helpful.\"]",

It will amaze you whenever you visit it.The Venetian port of Chania, including the Venetian lighthouse, is one of the symbols of the city and a favorite walking area for locals and visitors alike.The lighthouse of Chania differs from others of its time and cannot be classified in any standard lighthouse category. The architecture reminds one of a minaret, and it does not include a lighthouse keeper sleeping quarters, given the fact that it is located in an inhabited area.The Venetian shipyards (Arsenali, in Italian) were used for the repairing of ships during the winter, in the years of the Venetian rule. The largest complex was built between 1526 and 1599 and it consisted of 17 vaulted constructions. The Moro arsenals (named after the governor or Provveditore Generale) were built in 1607. Only two of them survive entire today, while the third one collapsed during the bomb-raids of 1941.\"},{\"title\":\"Getting around\",\"value\":\"WALKING DISTANCES:Venetian Port: You are hereMunicipal parking:       500 meters awayPublic Market:                 6 minutesArcheological Museum: 10 minutesMaritime Museum:         10 minutesBeach Koum Kapi:           5 minutesPublic buses: www.e-ktel.com/en/We are at your disposal in order to help you to discover Chania: Taxi or transfer service, Excursions, Car rental service, etc.Central Bus Station:       10 minutesCentral Taxi Station:         5 minutes\"}]",

It will amaze you whenever you visit it.\n<br>\nThe Venetian port of Chania, including the Venetian lighthouse, is one of the symbols of the city and a favorite walking area for locals and visitors alike.\n<br>\nThe lighthouse of Chania differs from others of its time and cannot be classified in any standard lighthouse category. The architecture reminds one of a minaret, and it does not include a lighthouse keeper sleeping quarters, given the fact that it is located in an inhabited area.\n<br>\nThe Venetian shipyards (Arsenali, in Italian) were used for the repairing of ships during the winter, in the years of the Venetian rule. The largest complex was built between 1526 and 1599 and it consisted of 17 vaulted constructions. The Moro arsenals (named after the governor or Provveditore Generale) were built in 1607. Only two of them survive entire today, while the third one collapsed during the bomb-raids of 1941.\n</span>\n",

         "[\"Yolanda has welcomed us very well, always attentive and proactive to give us instructions and help us. The space is  large, very well lit, and was impeccable: all very well cared for, organized and very clean. And her coffee is wonderful! The best of Cuba for us.\",\"We had an amazing stay with Yolanda! Yolanda is extremely welcoming and helpful. She was available to organise anything that we needed during our stay. The breakfast was absolutely delicious!! The flat was pristine and well stocked. The strong air con was well received after a hot day of exploring Cienfuegos. We highly recommend Yolanda's home.\",\"Yolanda is friendly and the house is perfect and well located. 100% recommended\",\"The place is very clean , well kept and in great condition. The fridge is pre-loaded with water and beers, at very reasonable prices, which is always appreciated. Location is great, very central and convenient, easy to walk everywhere around town. The apartment itself is inside the house, which means you'll open the front door and step in to their living room where the hosts family can sit and watch TV. The apartment is on the second level and it's \\\"private\\\" but like stated, you do walk through their house to get there, meaning not a private entrance. Yolanda is helpful and caring, in my opinion a little too caring and observing.. I felt watched and observed the little time I spent there. Also I was sat down in a rocking chair first thing checking in to be informed sternly about rules and regulations. In 20-30 rentals in Cuba I've never had that scrutiny in my visit, almost implying I'm there to engage in sex trade. Not very welcoming. Good place to stay and sleep though, but barely\",\"The appartment is a private floor in the house and very nice  and clean (hall, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and terrace!). You dont have your own entrance (from the street), however this is no problem. Yolanda is an amazing cook, the breakfast was great and we would also highly recommend the diner, both served on your own terrace.  Yolandas english is not very good, however she is very nice and helpfull and together we understood and everyting worked out great.\",\"Well located accommodation in Cienfuegos, with important places to see nearby. Yolanda was very kind, she told us all the places we could see and gave us all the help we needed for our stay. The top floor was completely ours, so we had a lot of privacy, a bathroom with everything you need, a terrace where you can make clothes and another terrace where you can sit and have a quiet drink. Beds were comfortable and we had A/C and a fan. Of course, the stay was exceptional.\",\"We stayed 2 nights in this beautiful place. The service was wonderful as were the breakfasts. This house is an oasis of peace in Cuba. Yolanda helped us with whatever we needed.\",\"The room upstairs is truly worth the money. It was significantly better than the rooms we had in Havana or Vinales.<br/>Bathroom seems to be brand new refurbished and super clean.<br/>There's a terrace where you can have breakfast or a drink.<br/>Yolanda herself is very friendly person.\",\"Touch and escape from Cienfuegos, clean accommodation, very helpful family. Terrace with privacy. Great breakfast! Fantastic grandma's mango jam.\",\"Yolanda was a great host! Even without knowing english she will accomodate all the problems! I had a medical issue and she has been amazing!\",\"Yolanda was very attentive to everything during our stay. The room is exactly as shown in the pictures. Recommended!\",\"Site well located and clean. The only downside is that it's up to the host to open the door for you to open.\",\"Both Yolanda and her mother are very attentive and charming.<br/>We recommend staying at his place.\",\"Large room with a private terrace and  a large bathroom. All in pristine condition. It has a kitchen and refrigerator.\",\"good room with terrace in downtown Cienfuegos\",\"This was one of the best AirBnbs where we lived. The room was clean and breakfast was more then expected. The hosts are so kind and always willing to help out. We had so much fun and would recommend to 100% to have a stay there. <br/>Keep in mind that internet in cuba is very limited. If the host is giving you access, you should give a tip. This is my recommendation and a good way to show gratitude. <br/>This was one of the best AirBnbs we have lived in. The room was clean and the breakfast was very versatile.

If the host gives you access, they should give you a tip. This is my recommendation and good way to show gratitude\",\"The accommodation is very centrally located. The hosts were very friendly and were always helpful. The apartment is very nice. The private terrace  was my personal favorite place. Cleaning was almost always daily. It has always been made to make sure that the towels are fresh and there are enough hygiene items. Especially in Covid Times. The  hosts were very attentive and wanted to fulfill every wish. Within a few minutes you can discover different sights. The Malecon is a 10-minute walk away. This place is recommended when the sun goes down. I highly recommend the Casa. We will definitely come back. We were very excited and satisfied with the service and accommodation. Keep up the good work. It was a pleasure to spend my three weeks vacation with you. Good luck to the future.\",\"Yolanda was a great host. That day we arrived late and there had been a problem with Airbnb and it was also welcomed with a smile. The house is great and very well-kept and breakfast on the terrace is a luxury. Totally recommended.\",\"The house was very close to downtown and the terrace was great for a drink at night.<br/>Plus the service was great.\",\"Yolanda is a very friendly person, always quiet, I had an issue with my reservation, but Yolanda quickly found a solution  !\",\"very good option for Cienfuegos.\"]",

Everything was walkable to get too, we had a wonderful stay.\",\"Everything was incredible\",\"Casa Barco is located in a very walkable area. If you are taking the ferry or a water taxi to get to Cancun, this spot makes pick up and drop off super simple. It is loud because of the street noise. <br/>Pros:<br/>Great A/C<br/>Location is very walkable and near lots of amazing restaurants and the market <br/>Very friendly and kind staff<br/>Things to note:<br/>This is a hotel, not a house. There is a small fridge and coffee bar. <br/>It is loud because of the street noise.\",\"We stayed for one night only, everything was prefect\",\"We had a perfect stay at Casa Barco. Staff at both the hotel and restaurant below were friendly and helpful, and fixed a squeaky door when we asked. Good food and drink at the street level restaurant, along with live music in the afternoons, we passed many pleasant and relaxing hours there. Highly recommend.\",\"Nice room, good ocean view and very central location that was easily walkable to most things you would want to do.  Only complaint is that given what we paid for the room no towels were provided for use at their pool and no drinking glasses were provided in the room.  Small points but would have been a nice touch.\",\"Casa Barco has been one of the best Airbnb’s I’ve stayed at and I’ve frequented many. The unit is spotless, comfortable, and in an excellent location right near the Ferry and Go Cart Rentals. Book this place!\",\"The accommodation was nice, clean, overlooking the harbor,<br/>a short walk from the centre and to the North beach, where the sea is beautifully blue\",\"The suite, decor, location and excellent cleanliness.  No option to bill not digital chain, not stamped for sat (Mexico).\",\"Second time here. Great location that is clean with a great host. They actually have a maid service that cleaned everyday (so nice!). 5/5 would recommend. Only thing I would say is the fridge is small, so you cannot store much in there and definitely no ice.\",\"It was a good stay at Marina Bartolomé. we enjoyed our space and it was quite nice! good views of the sunset from our balcony. The room was clean, and cleaned by housekeeping staff frequently. Everyone was very friendly!<br/>the hotel is located right on the busy main vehicle street of Isla Mujeres, so the sound of cars can be heard often until about midnight. not too noisy, but I highly recommend a set of ear plugs!\",\"Great deal! Will be staying here again!\",\"Super nice hotel with perfect location. The associated restaurant was also super delicious. All the staff were friendly and helpful:) <br/>Thanks for the great stay!\",\"Very nice room and comfortable and well located and good price value. There is only no attention or pool towels or sometimes no one was there to pay attention\",\"Perfect. Will definitely return\",\"Awesome views! Great services, want to come back!\",\"We absolutely loved it here!  Located right by the ferry which is perfect and has ocean front views, amazing!  Short walk to dump your bags, and then explore the north end of the island.  We walked everywhere on the north end and rented a golf cart for 1 day to see the rest.  Bed was comfortable, clean, frig, microwave, coffee maker, all the things you need.  Only improvement I would say is to add luggage rack or something so you can put your luggage on.  We will always stay here when we come to Isla Mujeres!\",\"Clean modern hotel room! Loved our large balcony and view!\",\"Strategic location… meters from the port where the Ferry arrives and a few blocks from the main pedestrian where the bars and restaurants are.<br/>From the beach it will be about 5 or 6 blocks... but easy to walk.<br/>It also has the bus stop that takes you to Playa Sur a few meters away.<br/>What was a bit “loose” was the restaurant downstairs… I had read the positive reviews… and I went with a high expectation. We went for breakfast and the truth is that everything was very busy... gladly in relation to the price. We didn't really give it another chance.\",\"Looked exactly like in the photos! The view is amazing & the bed was super comfortable. Had everything we needed and we could even check-in earlier, which was very much appreciated! :) Amazing place to spend the night - I would definitely come back!!\",\"We had a lovely stay here at Casa Barco! Great location, great food in the restaurant below, great music, great views! Not to mention the host is wonderful and accommodating. It is super close to the ferry terminal which  made getting there a breeze. It’s a perfect spot to book if you’re a first timer to Isla Mujeres and want to take your time getting to know your way around :)\",\"Top location and suites are well equipped! Unique view and great host! The only drawback: The windows and doors insulate almost no noise and the suites are on a main traffic axis. For sensitive sleepers, that's nothing. It worked relatively well with earplugs. I also don't understand why it was no longer invested because the rest was really spotless! 3-fold glazed windows and a decent door don't cost too much these days. Too bad - that's a point deduction but I would book it again\",\"Had such an amazing stay here! Host was very helpful and responsive. Very clean and was so impressed with the beautiful views! Will be back!\",\"Spectacular! As in the photos. Super clean and beautiful overlooking the ocean. Would repeat!\"]",

We were a bit surprised to find out 5 days before our stay about the extra cost for bed linen ($20/pax) but to be honest it was stated in the description which obviously didn’t read in full. Otherwise the  place was great for the value.\",\"The house was lovely, with a fantastic location that made it easy to explore the area.

Very well provisioned.\",\"A comfortable family home, with enough space for the 5 of us. Unfortunately the weather wasn't great this weekend so didn't get much of a chance to walk the surrounds,  but it's a lovely peaceful location.\",\"If you're reading this and still weighing your options, book this place!

The house was spacious and well-equipped, with every kitchen tool imaginable, making it feel like a real home away from home. We loved the big dining table where we could all eat together, and the pantry essentials (tea/coffee/condiments) meant we could settle in straight away. The garden, pool table, and table tennis were a hit for both kids and adults. The beach was a short walk away, but we preferred the nearby lake for swimming since the ocean was quite rough during our stay. The house was comfortable, with plenty of space to relax, and the hosts provided thoughtful touches with books, toys, excess toiletries and laundry essentials. It was great value for money, and we’d love to come back again. A few more bins in the rooms & for recycling would have been helpful, but overall, it was the perfect spot for a fun family getaway. Great communication and check in from Laurence made us feel very welcome.\",\"We stayed at Lawrence’s place for my 20th birthday weekend and the house was amazing upon arrival, there was lots to do in the house and around the area.

         "[\"The place is gorgeous both the cosy inside and the lovely farm views with the friendly cows! Julie’s probably the most considerate and hospitable host we have ever had the pleasure to stay with! We had the best time!\",\"Julie’s Airbnb is a 10/10 spot, it’s very clean yet cozy, surrounded by beautiful views and extremely friendly cows! It was a very easy booking process and check in. Everytime we needed help with something she was there to hand straight away. The location is very convenient, very short travels to countless beautiful beach towns and plenty to do ( even with the heavy rain we had lol). Julie provides a substantial amount of snacks, goodies and light breakfast foods which was lovely, also plenty of hot and cold drinks to hand. <br/>We both loved are stay here and would like to return one day! <br/>Many thanks David and Ceri\",\"Our stay was the perfect weekend away to relax and unwind. The directions Julie provided were easy to follow and we had no trouble finding the property. Upon arrival we were greeted with a friendly face which made us feel right at home. The property itself was spotless, we couldn’t fault it. There was a huge selection of food and drink options in the room, something for everyone! Julie also provided a large range of toiletries and anything else you may have forgotten to pack. Julie has considered absolutely everything guests may need on their stay. <br/>Thank you so much for a lovely weekend. We would love to stay at the property again in the future :)\",\"We stayed for a week in Julie's clean and comfortable annex, there is no kitchen but the very generous supply of drinks and snacks provided was helpful. The view from the room is panoramic with fields of grazing cows and  countryside beyond, it really is a special spot. Generally the location is pretty perfect for exploring the stunning Ceredigion  coast with its coastal paths and sandy beaches. <br/>Thanks for a great holiday Julie !\",\"Had a feeling that Julie’s place was going to tick our boxes and it exceeded expectations!!  We needed a private bolt hole and somewhere to just exist for a few days and it was perfect!  Quiet, well stocked, perfect sunsets, clean and a field full of cows!  What more could you wish for!  Thank you Julie! \uD83D\uDE0A\",\"Julie was a great host. Came to greet us and left lots of info and left us alone which is exactly how we like it. She left LOADS of breakfast supplies and drinks ect in the room. She even left two little bunny eggs as we stayed over Easter. Lots of toiletries she really thought of everything and left it for us. The place was beautiful, spotless clean and all modern and fresh. The view well, it was amazing!! We wanted a place out of the way to relax but close enough todo things if we wanted, the place is so nice it's hard to leave. A lovely place to recharge the batteries!\",\"Julie is the most welcoming host I have come across and also has the best Air bnb I have used. Julie’s place was beautiful, extremely clean and fully stocked with everything you could need! The views were beautiful and the linens and towels smelt amazing! Julie was there to welcome us and told us to let her know if we needed anything, which we didn’t as everything was already provided! Julie also provided recommendations for the area which we used and we had delicious meals! We also loved seeing the curious cows as we came into the lane! Thanks again for hosting us in your beautiful home!\",\"Everything exceeded our expectations from the moment we arrived to when we had to leave. Julie had thought of everything and I mean absolutely everything! Generously stocked cupboards with food items for breakfast and snacks, milk, bread, butter, cereal, drinks, water, tea, coffee etc etc. the bathroom was also fully stocked and immaculate.<br/>The views were breathtaking & the cows became our best friends. <br/>Highly recommend, you won’t be disappointed\",\"This is a beautiful, well presented modern little property. With views over the Welsh countryside it is quiet and peaceful.  I only became aware there was no kitchen facilities after I booked it but Julie provides everything for hot drinks and a cereal inspired breakfast. The lack of a kitchen is reflected in the price but it would be helpful if it was stated more clearly in the text.\",\"I had an incredible stay! The place was spotless, beautifully decorated, and had all the amenities I needed. The host was incredibly responsive and helpful, making sure everything was perfect. The location was ideal, very very peaceful. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others! Many thanks, Tom\",\"One of the most amazing stays we’ve ever had! An absolutely wonderful host, the place was immaculate and the location was incredible. The fridge was stocked with delicious goodies and plenty of snacks available too! It felt like Julie had thought of absolutely everything you may need for your stay. <br/>Apart from the cows being the superstars of the whole stay we got to meet the lovely farmers too who told us all about their cattle. Everyone was so friendly and made us feel right at home!<br/>The location is perfect if you’re looking to enjoy peace and quiet but also want to explore. There are some really amazing walks and adventures (plenty of ideas provided by Julie, a whole folder you can choose from for ideas in the area!).<br/>Overall it was the best few days, exactly what we were looking for and honestly hope to come back someday. Highly, highly recommend!!\",\"We absolutely loved staying at this Airbnb. The attention to detail and thought at this place is impeccable. Everything you could want for breakfast, a stash of toiletries for anything you’ve forgotten and items to take to the beach too! The country setting is beautiful and made for a relaxing getaway. Julie’s recommendations for places to eat and things go in the local area were also amazing.  Would highly recommend this place!\",\"We stayed here for three nights and must say it's one our best experiences. The accommodation is spot on,  the views are outstanding and the peace and quiet rejuvenating. We were met by Julie on arrival and instantly felt welcome.\",\"Julie was an amazing host, she was extremely helpful after a family emergency.<br/>Our stay was amazing Julie has thought of  everything you could need and more to make our stay comfortable and relaxing.<br/>The farm is beautiful and quite for a tranquil relaxing stay.<br/>we cannot wait to be back again later in the year.\",\"Julie was an amazing host. When we walked in there were lots of recommendations for us to do locally. The place was lovely and we had so much food we didn’t know what to do with it all! If i was to visit this area again, i’d definitely stay here again.\",\"We had a wonderful stay at Julies's place.<br/>Probably the best Airbnb we've ever done !<br/>The place is very quiet, spacious with a very nice view and very clean.<br/>There is everything you need to eat and more  for breakfast.<br/>Julie is an amazing host.<br/>It really deserves more than 5 stars !\",\"We had a wonderful stay at Julie's place! Julie was a wonderful host who prepared the place with a lot of love and immediately made us feel welcome. The AirBnB is perfect for relaxing days, during the day you can make nice excursions to beaches nearby and in the evening enjoy the quiet atmosphere around the accommodation. We highly recommend the place and hope to come again!\",\"What an amazing find......will be returning at the end of the summer!!<br/>Soooo peaceful & private a total escape!!<br/>Julie had thought of everything, extremely generous with breakfast supplies & toiletries.<br/>Perfectly placed to explore the coast or the countryside.<br/>The cows in the field were hilariousously inquisitive and tame!! And watching the swallows was a delight!!<br/>Thank you Julie it was such a wonderful stay.....if you are looking to unwind this is the place to be!! Xx\",\"We absolutely loved staying at Julie’s air b&b. It was so clean and stocked full with everything we could need. It was so clean and the bed was super comfortable.

The place was super equipped, modern and cozy and the ingredients for breakfast were more than plentiful. <br/>We felt very welcome at Julie's place and would love to come back \uD83D\uDE0A\",\"Absolutely perfect second stay!<br/>We loved everything about our stay, it was quiet and really relaxing. The stay is extremely private with your own entrance so you can come and go as you please. The rooms were spotless and had everything you could possibly need and so much more! <br/>Julie is super friendly and helpful and always at hand if you should ever need anything. <br/>We got to share our stay with the cows this time too! they are super curious and love coming over to say hello! with the added bonus that they are really quiet so no worries about any noise.<br/>I honestly can't reccomended this place enough!\",\"This lovely annexe is a gem in the countryside.  Such a peaceful location yet only a short drive from the coast.  There were also opportunities to take walks direct from the property.  Julie had thought of everything to ensure a stress-free visit.  There is no kitchen in the property but the array of breakfast goodies plus fruit and snacks together with a kettle and toaster ensured we were well served.  Lots of great places to eat locally but please be sure to book as the best can be busy.  Our only disappointment was we had to leave. Definitely on our list of favourites.\",\"Julie went above and beyond to make our stay very enjoyable. The cupboards had everything we needed and more, she thought of every single detail.<br/>Lovely person and made  us feel very welcome. It was great view from our patio doors and we looked onto fields full of cows.<br/>Great base to come back to after visiting all the local beaches, which were beautiful.<br/>Would 100% recommend and will definitely visit again.Thank you Julie. x\"]",

         "[\"stay was great. When we asked for late check in host was accomodating. Place is really beautifull. If I would say something negative about the place it would be that fridge is fairly small for 3 people and host didn't provide us with garbage stamps, which you have to buy in bulk of around 10 for 33 franks. We needed one. Over all, I would stay again.\",\"We had a great time in Waldenburg. The town is very nice and from the terrace upstairs you can even see the ruin of Waldenburg. The house is large and very clean. Cozy furnishings. It has everything you need. Annegret and her husband are very nice and good hosts! Check in and out with key box very straightforward. Glad to come back!\",\"The location is perfect for anyone who enjoys nature and trekking! The property is cleaned and spacious and ideal for families with children! <br/>Brilliant friendly host!\",\"Very nice house with garden. Very nice to unwind or to start day trips in all directions. Glad to come back!\",\"A very nice house, super located (beautiful landscape, several restaurants to reach on foot in a few minutes; the nearest supermarket but only in about 2 km). Still very quiet at night. Lots of privacy through the private entrance, beautiful garden, hiking trails just around the corner (however, all paths except in the village are hilly, possibly not suitable for people with walker etc.). The house (kitchen, laundry room, barbecue area, etc. ) is perfectly equipped, even for a long stay. There was enough space for 5 people plus a baby. We definitely recommend the house!\",\"We had a great family vacation and were able to enjoy the swimming pool in the village very much. It was the hit for us!  Super stylish place.\",\"A secret tip for nature lovers<br/>After a personal introduction by the host, who also showed us the first sights on the way from the train station, we were able to experience adventurous and relaxing holidays in the beautiful old house. The furnishings are basic but very chosen. All furniture is harmoniously selected and fit perfectly into the house with their clear design style and robust character. The kitchen offers everything your heart desires. Since the kitchen herbs grow right at your doorstep, supplies are also automatically provided here. <br/>During the day we enjoyed the many hiking trails around Waldenburg, whereby we especially liked the small ponds under the dragon hole. This is where we also found Ammonites and other estuaries.<br/>The large terrace behind the house offers a cool, windless spot, where you can enjoy the view of Waldenburg Castle to the last ray of the sun. With a delicacy, prepared on the large wooden grill and a glass of wine, every evening is a successful end to the day.\",\"Really nice house. Big thanks for this unforgettable stay.\"]",

         "[\"The place is extremely central and so it can be noisy at night but that is just part and parcel of being so central. Unfortunately it had stains on the linen and carpet and sticky stuff on the carpet in the bedroom. The place was not clean. The host only sent out standard responses  which seemed to have been pre prepared but did not communicate to answer any questions asked or otherwise communicate\",\"Perfect location and a spacious apartment. The instructions for key collection were clear and easy to follow. However, given the high cleaning fee it was disappointing the apartment had evidently not been cleaned to a high standard before our arrival. There were hand marks across the mirrors, no drinking glasses, heavy dust in the bedroom on blinds and shelves, noticeable mould around the bath / shower.\",\"Wonderful central location and photos gave very clear instructions on how to find the apartment. Bedroom was spacious and a super comfy bed. Living area large and great to spend time in. Really handy having fans in both the bedroom and living room - very much appreciated on a hot summer afternoon! Beautiful apartment that I very much looked forward to coming back at the end of the day!\",\"Highly recommend this flat if you’re looking for a stay in Brighton! It’s in the prime spot, minutes walk to the beach & The Lanes- couldn’t have got a better location!! It’s perfect if you want to be in the hustle and bustle of the shops, restaurants etc however not overly noisy.<br/>Perfect for myself, boyfriend and two small dogs. Even though it is dog friendly, it was still really clean- so if you’re petless don’t worry it doesn’t smell like dog etc. <br/>The flat was clean & tidy, exactly as described. It’s modern and spacious, great for a few nights stay. The living area was really reasonable, with a smart TV and lovely warm cosy lighting. Very homely once settled in. The bathroom was modern and sleek, clean but did have a little mould in the shower (but I’d say this is to be expected and wasn’t awful). <br/>The instructions to find & check in were so clear, was very impressed! The flat is accessible but felt safe/secure, despite being bang in the centre of town.\",\"We had a great weekend in Brighton and really enjoyed our stay here\",\"A really beautiful flat in a perfect location. We were walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go. The hosts were really responsive and helpful with every question I had.<br/>The sofa bed was a little odd in that the pull out was not the same height as the rest of the sofa and it was a bit small for one person to just lie on the pull out. Other than that, the flat was great.<br/>My friends and I would all definitely stay again.\",\"Location was very central to everything and access was easy. The apartment itself should’ve been cleaned better before new occupants - for a cleaning fee you’d expect it to be clean. <br/>Overall, it was okay. It was conveniently located to most attractions, but please make sure the cleaning company actually cleans. It is spacious too which is a plus.\",\"Spacious, tastefully furnished and spotlessly clean flat in the centre of town. We were concerned that it might be noisy at night, but we had no issues and had a good rest. The check-in process was unusual but easy to follow. The heating did not work in the lounge, and though we were told someone was going to fix it did not happen. We would stay again, given the heating gets fixed.\",\"Lovely and clean apartment in the center of Brighton with spacious and well-furnished rooms. Perfect location for walking to the beach, shops, pubs, and landmarks. Highly recommended.\",\"The place is amazing!<br/>I felt like home. It’s near all needed shops, groceries and even the mall. There’s even a 24/7 store open, so it is very convenient.<br/>There were a few concerns that I had but the over all experience was great and the host is very responsive.<br/>Will definitely book this place the next time I get a chance.<br/>Thank you!\",\"What a great location! Right in the middle of Brighton, just a two minute walk from Churchill Orange carpark. Absolutely perfect for our stay. The apartment is nice and big, very clean and has everything you need.<br/>Check in and key collection was nice and easy, be aware that Costa no longer exists though but you should be able to find it with the instructions.<br/>One suggestion would be blackout blinds in the bedroom as it was like sleeping with the lights on due to all the highly lit shops right outside. Other than this, we would definitely look to return due to the amazing location.\",\"Great stay! First of all, perfect location! close to the beach and all the fun pubs. Basic and clean appartment, all things necessary are available. Fast en nice communication with the host. Would recommend!\",\"We were looking for a central place and as Luke had told us it was.<br/>The sound insulation quality of the apartment allowed us to live there in a high quality silence despite the outside traffic.<br/>Proximity to sea is also a highlight.<br/>We highly recommend this rental to any guest wishing to discover this seaside resort in optimal conditions.\",\"Great location!\",\"Luke was very helpful in providing clear instructions for both check in and check out and the place was lovely. Large and spotless, great location and not noisy at night! I would definitely stay there again!\",\"Our stay itself in the flat was perfect, great location, and more than enough space for 4 people. The only complain is that the host was not very responsive to my messages when i had some questions before the trip.\",\"Amazing stay at Luke’s for my birthday! So central and everything just a stone throw away! Perfect for just a chill night too and staying in to cook dinner. Would definitely return!!\",\"Great little spot central located with good modern furniture. The only negative aspect was that traffic noise and construction within the building made sleeping past 6 am very difficult.\",\"4 of us stayed here for the night and were so pleased with the super convenient location. We just had to step outside to get to restaurants, bars and shops.<br/>Everything in the apartment was clean, modern, and comfortable.<br/>Would absolutely stay there again!\",\"Jake and staff were just amazing! Good communication and the apartment is stunning. The only thing that could be improved would be to have an extra fan in the room so it wouldn't be so stuffy. Thank you so much for the lovely weekend in Brighton :)\",\"Very good stay despite the work on the street until midnight and in the apartment above during the day. Central placement. Just missing glasses ... (there are only 2 glasses on foot)\",\"Lovely flat with a central location. Communication with the hosts was prompt and smooth. Easy check-in. Very clean and well-equipped apartment.\",\"The flat is centrally located and quite spacious. Overall, our stay was pleasant, but communication with the hosts was somewhat challenging. We provided feedback that the third bed we had booked was not made, and we had to search for the bedding (which was found under the couch), in addition to the malfunctioning heating system. Unfortunately, there was no response regarding the third bed, and despite our observation that the heating was not functioning while we were in the flat, the hosts insisted that it was working. Additionally, please note that the Costa Coffee mentioned in their instructions for locating the flat no longer exists, so don't get confused when you are looking for it.\",\"Great location however was disappointed. The cleaner didn’t drop the keys off on time so we had to wait 45mins past our check in time - this wasn’t great as chucking down with rain and we had lots of bags. The heating was broken in the living room so very cold - I had a poor night’s sleep  on the sofa bed and v cold in the morning . A shame there weren’t any batteries in the remote control as the tv couldn’t be accessed manually so wasn’t able to use . A guide to the house would’ve been helpful eg you need to go into the cleaning cupboard to turn on the towel rail on in the bathroom & the touch screen heater in the bedroom-we had to message quite a few times to work stuff out,which was irritating. However we did get an immediate response .\"]",

         "Chalé da Picareta is a recent construction and managed by Luciane and Darcio.  The main attraction is that it is the only lodging option in São Roque de Minas that is closest to the Serra da Canastra National Park - it is 4 km from the entrance and in the park a few kilometers away is the source of the São Francisco River, a region much visited by tourists and mountaineers who want to venture out and enjoy nature!The spaceAfter 25 years of exploring only the camping area, Chalé da Picareta was built to offer greater comfort to tourists and mountain adventurers. It is an excellent accommodation for families and groups of up to 4 people, in a quiet and cozy environment. It's not an inn, what we offer is an immersive experience at the ranch! You'll love connecting with the rhythm of the mountain. Masonry chalet, with a large balcony and mountain view. The large bedroom has a double bed and two single beds, with a flat-screen TV and air-conditioning. Full kitchen with microwave, stove, refrigerator and complete utensils. Full bathroom with electric shower. The story of the Picareta farm:In 1967, when Chico Chagas and Dona Teresinha bought the farm, they discovered a pickaxe stuck in the stone. This pickaxe dates back to the slave era when they explored the region with dynamites, pickaxes and other tools. Tourists try to remove it every year, but to no avail. Thus, this historic object gave its name to the Picareta farm. Another landmark of the place that highlights the time of slavery in the region are the stone walls that the farm still has today. As sad as this past is, it is true and its traces can be observed and studied by those who visit the region to help us understand human deeds.Guest accessThe chalet's access is totally privateParking next to the chalet Access to trails and waterfalls within the farm Access to the stream that runs the full length of the farmOther things to noteIn front of the bedroom window is a pergola that houses a hammock for relaxing. There is a stream that runs the length of the entire farm and a beautiful trail along its banks.We will be happy to give tips on hiking and tours in the region. In the central house of the farm, there is always a piece of Serra da Canastra cheese, sassafras cachaça and fresh coffee available as courtesy gifts from the Chagas family.",

         "[\"The picareta cottage is perfect \uD83D\uDC96 <br/>It is close to the Serra da Canastra National Park.<br/>Everything I needed was in the cottage.<br/>Everything was new.<br/>peaceful and quiet place.<br/>Dona Terezinha and her Chico are very attentive.<br/>There are mango trees.<br/>And a clean river for bathing on the property <br/>I wanted to live there. A wonderful view.<br/>I intend to return.<br/>I just have to thank Luciene for sharing a very well-kept paradise.\",\"We went as a couple and we really liked the cottage, it has a beautiful view of the mountains, in addition to being totally quiet, we only heard the birds. Luciane and her relatives are all very cordial and helpful. They helped us with everything we needed, there was still cake and cheese when we arrived at the cottage. The cottage fully consistent with the photos. We highly recommend it!!!\",\"Sensational!<br/>The place is a wonderful place and next to Canastra Park. <br/>The cleaning of the chalet is impeccable and everything is very complete and well arranged. <br/>Mr. Chico and his family are great people, very friendly and good hosts. <br/>It's a place to keep in our hearts. <br/>Thank you so much for everything!\",\"Everything was great. The description and photos perfectly match what the cottage and surroundings offer. We spent a few days in direct contact with the rustic and beautiful nature of the place and at the same time pampered by the comfort that the chalet offers. Complete privacy. It has everything we need. Luciane and Darcio were always efficient, super kind and generous. We will miss it and hope to return one day.\",\"Very good stay, the hosts were very responsive and the cottage is a cutie, well located near entrance 2.\",\"I had a great conversation with the owner, I found the place easily after she sent me the location. The place is beautiful, breathtaking view and a silence and connection with the unspeakable nature. It was easy to find, and an ordinary car can get there quietly. I was very well received and I was lucky to have contact with amazing animals such as dogs, horses, otter and others. The city is close and the house is very comfortable, clean and tidy. The kitchen has everything I needed to make breakfast and dinner. I highly recommend it and will be back more often.\",\"From the time the host was confirmed, the host responded quickly and gave all the information about the location. The place itself is well organized, contains the necessary items to spend small and large periods of stays. The owners of the place are very helpful, the surrounding landscape is lush, since it is located near the road that gives access to the entrance to the upper part of the park, finally the owners of the place were very helpful and knowledgeable in the region. It is a wonderful place, great to stay and fine and humble people to welcome us.\",\"Excellent Picareta Cottage! <br/>The place is beautiful, very close to the park and very well located. <br/>The place was very clean and it was clear that it was taken care of with great affection! <br/>The hosts were great, all of them great in prose and very helpful!\",\"The Chalet of the Picareta is simply charming! Our stay was peaceful and very fruitful. The chalet is on a farm that has a river in the background, the waters are crystal clear  and quiet, they form several wells and natural pools. We had amazing days in this place, as the chalet is very close to the Serra da Canastra Park and it was possible to visit the top of Casca D'Danta in addition to the waterfalls of the Capão Forro Complex.  For those who wish to disconnect from the busy life, the cottage is the place! The owner Luciana is very polite and always responds to messages very carefully. We were greeted with a splendid cornmeal cake, cheeses, and pastries. Mr Chico, who welcomed us, is very friendly and polite! I want to go back.\",\"Perfect location, quiet location, flawless accommodation, super receptive staff. The arrival MIMO was perfect! We loved the cottage! Excellent experience!\",\"This is a special place.<br/>We often look for tours in search of adventure, trails with different levels of difficulty, incredible visuals with waterfalls, native forest, contact with nature in the purest and most genuine way, the surroundings of the Chalet has all this, with trails inside the farm space and good indications of attractions and tours in the city. <br/>The location is great and makes it easy to access several Serra waterfalls, downtown markets and restaurants.<br/>The Chalet is wonderful, everything is very clean and organized, with all the necessary utensils in the kitchen for longer stays, ample space that accommodates well 4 people with all the care of those who like to receive and treat their visits well.<br/>The warm welcome from the hosts, with pampering left in the fridge and the constant invitation to a coffee, piece of cheese, and good prose, make days better and less busy.<br/>And that's the main point, the place is beautiful and everything emanates peace, quiet and quiet. <br/>We'll be back soon!\",\"Great the Chalet, wonderful place, lush nature.<br/>Kind and solicitous homeowners.<br/>I recommend it.\",\"Our stay was amazing! The place is very beautiful, clean and the host was very helpful and helpful, helped us with everything we need! There is a camping in the area, but the chalet gives us a lot of privacy, we don't hear any noise beyond the river that passes through the property. Overall a beautiful place is well worth it I want to go back \uD83E\uDD70\",\"We love our Chalet Hosting. The host was very considerate and we felt very welcome. Among our hosting through the Serra da Canastra was undoubtedly the most comfortable. The chalet is quite spacious, very well equipped, with everything new and organized. Special highlight about the cleanliness that was spotless.<br/>The chalet is inside a property where there is a camping,  it is quite wide and has a no loud sound permission policy that is followed and well managed. We didn't have any noise issues even though we stayed for a holiday.<br/>The location is excellent, close to the National Park, gave us the way to some tours and for us (who were looking for peace and quiet) it was great not to be in the city. <br/>We would definitely return.\",\"Wonderful place, super clean, full chalet and breathtaking view! The owners were super considerate kind and treated us very well!!! We will come back and indicate with eyes closed!!\",\"Excellent option to be in the country without losing the refinement of a very pleasant chalet.\"]",

So kind and the bed was super comfy! I’ll definitely be staying here again!\",\"I was looking for exactly this kind of accommodation. I pulled over on 80 as I was heading towards Rocky Springs and found it so easily and was able to communicate with Brayden in super fast response time. It is open concept upstairs and a well stocked kitchen with a big fridge/freezer. There was another guest there the first night who was super quiet and friendly. Brayden's home is sequestered in a nice quiet safe neighborhood and for the next 2 days had the place to myself! Wow...it was perfect for seeing clients remotely, making food, and even watched TV on the big screen one night. There is a washing machine and dryer and well...it's just a great place and would definitely return. And there is a great family style restaurant called Marty's nearby that had a great salad and lasagna and the portions are huge! Rock on Rocky Springs and bravo Brayden!\",\"My stay was super! Brayden is very good at communicating. I am certain that this was the best place I could have chosen. Great neighborhood, plenty of space along with amenities in each individual room. Felt right at home. Interior and exterior well maintained. Comfortable and clean. Felt safe and happy it looked exactly like the pictures. Thank you for a wonderful stay!\",\"Great guy! Great house!

I’d gladly stay here again.\",\"I really enjoyed staying at Brayden's place! It was quiet, clean, and exactly as described. As a single female traveling across the country, I really appreciated how safe I felt at Brayden's listing. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay the night!

         "[\"Very nicely furnished, spacious and sparkling clean apartment! The way to the old town takes only 10 minutes walking and next to the house is a nice little park. The apartment has one large balcony, unfortunately there is a very busy road in front of it. However, it is pleasantly quiet for sleeping, as the window goes to the other side.  Check-in is flexible and hosts respond immediately to messages. There were a lot of information materials in the apartment. <br/>All in all recommendable!\",\"Extremely modern and clean apartment with great location to the old town of Zadar for a good price :) we really enjoyed our stay!\",\"The apartment is nice, big and very clean. It is modern, has a good equipped kitchen and the balcony is perfect for relaxing in the evening. It is very quiet in the apartmen and only 12min walk to the old town/water. We would definitely come back again.\",\"Very great and nice hosts!  The apartment was clean and spacious.  There were no problems and otherwise they will help you quickly.  We would always come back!\",\"Simply great!!\",\"Apartment Ena is a great place to spend a few days exploring Zagreb. Lovely location by a park and close to the old town, via a nice stroll by the water front. And and Ive are very good hosts and the apartment has everything you could want.\",\"What a wonderful place to stay! Ive I Ana’s place is lovely and peaceful. Max a 10 min drive to Zadar’s famous Sea Organ and Old Town. <br/>So clean and tidy, had everything we needed and more. <br/>They gave some great tips around local restaurants & places to visit. <br/>Thank you for having us!\",\"Lovely apartment, walking distance to all the sights and the town centre. Great shower, comfy bed and fab balcony to have your morning coffee. The kitchen was very well equipped and communication with Ana & Ive was great. They kindly left two beers in the fridge as a welcome drink too which was a lovely touch.\",\"The appartment of Ive I Ana is very clan, spacious, luxurious and perfect size with nice balcony. The location is 10/15 minutes walk from 'old town Zadar'. We enjoyed it a lot! As extras there were coffee cups, washing machine pods and dish washer pods, we even got free extra coffee cups. Surely a recommendation for staying in Zadar.\",\"Superb ! A comfortable pristine apartment in a wonderful location .\",\"Fabulous stylish apartment,  great location on the edge of a small park just around the corner from the harbour and a short walk to the  footbridge that crosses over  to the old town of Zadar. Kitchen well equipped but to be honest we only boiled eggs and the kettle and ate out in the excellent restaurants mostly recommended in the booklet at the apartment;  which is well written and gives hints and tips about the accommodation and local amenities.  Safe, free parking just outside the premises with no issues getting a space. As a daily runner much appreciated the large shower with super high water pressure  and with plenty of hot water and the 15 min. sports programme on the washing machine was a bonus!  We stayed six nights and were given plenty of towels and the offer to have bedding changed on request. We found a bike hire place (helmet & locks) on the edge of the park outside  with really decent bikes (Cube) and cycled the coastal path to Plaza Rt Puntamika, Petrcane and Plaza Punta Skala stopping for a swim at each. We also took the opportunity to take the bikes on the ferry from Gazenica, Zadar to Preko on the island of Uglijan (you can’t take bikes on the nearby ferries as they are for foot passengers only), lovely place to explore by bike and plenty of good spots for a swim. I think there were 3 apartments, in the building, they are well sound insulated , never heard a sound or footstep! We did pick up breakfast from Farma&rawfood (near the bridge our side) which offered excellent smoothies and chia breakfast and chocolate pots.  What a great holiday, location and apartment, highly recommend.\",\"Superbly decorated apartment with everything you need for a comfortable stay. Highly recommend to everyone.\",\"Amazing flat. Sparkling clean, has everything you need and hosts are so helpful. Just a 15 min walk to old town, which is beautiful. Close to supermarkets and bakeries. Can't fault this place.\",\"Ive and Ana's place is one of the favorites of our trip.<br/>It is very well located in a quiet area only 10 minutes' walk from the old city. Parking space in front of the house is a real plus. <br/>The beach is really not far away and Ive and Ana give a lot of tips at check-in.<br/>I totally recommend it!\",\"perfect stay in a new, well-equiped, clean, quiet, lovely designed apartment, only 10 minutes walk to the old part of the city centre. parking, coffee machine, helpful booklet/guide/map - everything makes our  stay perfect!\"]",

We were particularly impressed by the breathtaking views. Kim and Jakob were incredibly helpful and supported us with all our concerns. The only little thing we missed was a second bathroom (which according to Kim and Jakob is still in the planning stage :-) ) and the ceilings could be a little higher – but that's just nitpicking.

There is a small refrigerator with cheese, eggs and beer. With the guest card, many attractions can be used free of charge (e.g. the cable car in Bezau). We would recommend the place.\",\"We were two families, eight people and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The house is beautifully located in the middle of the mountains of the Bregenz Forest. <br/>Kim and Jakob have freshly laid eggs and other treats in an SB refrigerator. Milk and meat can be purchased from neighboring farms.<br/>We will be happy to come back!\",\"Really nice spot, close to Mellau/Damüls slopes!\",\"We were there as a group. 6 adults, 2 children, 2 infants and were very warmly received. Check-in and check-out was totally relaxed. Communication was very nice and everything was taken care of. Children's high chairs, cots, baths, plenty of toys in the sandbox, tricycle, swing, slide and and and. The children were allowed to feed the hens and play Frisbee in the adjoining field. The fact that it was already loud with us in the morning was not a problem at all. The location of the house was wonderful, we could go hiking directly and there was a lot to see for adults and children. In the center of Schwarzenberg is a well-equipped supermarket and a cafe with extremely good coffee and delicious cakes. Even in bad weather everything was very relaxed. In the house entrance space for shoes, umbrellas and fitted strollers, in the apartment a tile stove (which we did not use at all because we were constantly distracted) and games. A large dining table made sure that we first stayed as a group with children and then as a group among adult friends. Farm eggs, local cheese and milk, homemade syrup and herbal salt were for sale in the house entrance. We were happy and grateful to use it. Parking was right at the house, the kitchen well equipped, the bathroom super clean and comfortable. And as a sugar for me as a city person on top: absolute silence at night, so that you could find peace in the extremely cozy bedroom with the windows open. All in all, a very relaxing, relaxing and enriching stay. We would have loved to stay longer.\",\"This is the perfect place for families with kids. Fantastic surroundings, no traffic, animals, toys and fresh eggs, cheese, elderflower juice, etc. Many thanks to Kim for the great welcome and the nice time.\",\"Spacious apartment, extremely well maintained, quiet location, ideal for adventure tours, pleasant hosts, highly recommend.\",\"Very nice location. clean freshly renovated apartment Apartment over two floors!<br/>thanks to the hosts\"]",

         "[\"Sylvain is a great host, the villa and the amenities he set up are simply great! environment and magnificent view, we had a great week, to be recommended without hesitation!\",\"Stay was wonderful, Sylvain's house is perfectly clean, tidy, had everything we needed and is located in a quiet place next to Alès. The pool has a beautiful view and a really nice pool house. On top of that, Sylvain is really nice, and the communication was smooth. We enjoyed it a lot, and cannot recommend it enough. I hope we can come back next year !\",\"We’ve had a wonderful time in Rousson. The whole house was great. Superb balcony with magnificent view. A very cozy kitchen and nice living room. We especially liked the big entrances to the balcony both from kitchen and living room. The outside of the house was also splendid. The swimming pool with colorful light and the surrounding. The terrace in front of the swimming pool with couch and grill was great.<br/>The village is well located. Not far to all the famous towns and Camargue region.<br/>The only thing that we missed was air conditioning. Although we read before renting the house there’s no AC we spotted there are many air conditioners outside the house. They probably serve for the ground floor where the owners dwell or the AC will be available in the future. So if you look for it firstly ensure yourself by contacting with the owner.<br/>We were also a little bit worried about the deposit which was quite a huge. Perhaps it’s a standard custom in France. I didn’t check it before booking. However everything was fine and we got our money back the day we were leaving.<br/>So I can surely tell that Sylvian is a very nice and helpful host. He almost immediately reply to all our questions via the Airbnb messages. So make a booking and don’t worry at all \uD83E\uDD29\",\"Beautiful villa in a very quiet place.\",\"A real favorite for this sumptuous villa:)<br/>Sylvain's home shines with its cleanliness and complete equipment, both inside and in the pool area. In addition, its location is conveniently located for various activities.<br/>We received a warm welcome from Anne-Laure, who constantly took care of our well-being. Not only was she still available, but she also showed great proactivity throughout our stay.<br/>We were a group of eight people, and the property has plenty of space for everyone to enjoy their own living area.<br/>This place to stay, along with its host, has greatly contributed to the success of our holiday. I would recommend this place without hesitation.\",\"We had a great holiday in Sylvain's house, with our 2 teenagers and 2 children. The house is large and pleasant to live in, with a large balcony that gives a very nice view of the Cevennes hills. The pool with its fully equipped pool house, plancha, and ping pong table quickly became  the main living space:)! <br/>30 minutes around the house you can find any type of outings. Among them we particularly recommend riverside ginguettes in exceptional environments, the bamboo garden of Anduze as well as beautiful, and walks or jogging in the hills directly accessible from the house. <br/>We thank Sylvain for her kindness, discretion and availability to ensure our comfort.\",\"We had a pleasant pleasant stay in Villa de Sylvain, mainly in and around the pretty  pool and pool house (very equipped).<br/>Our host, Sylvain, was  discreet and attentive.<br/>We recommend it!\",\"We had a great time staying at Sylvain's house, booking without hesitation:)\",\"Welcoming and warm villa!<br/>Perfect for organizing your vacation with friends, there are many common areas available. In this wonderful weather we had access to the mountainous setting offered by the Plateau du Rousson. Hosts are respectful of privacy and are open to discussion. We have some really good memories! <br/>Margot & Angelo.\",\"A beautiful week of vacation, ideal with our 4 teenagers, the house is well equipped, the pool house and the living room, are equipment (wc, fridge, plancha, dishwasher) makes it functional, we took all our meals at this place. The host who lives in the basement of the house is more than discreet. Outdoor lighting is a  real plus to spend a beautiful evening around the pool. I would recommend it 100%.\",\"Sylvain's property is just beautiful!! We had a memorable stay!!!!<br/> Nothing is missing: the pool house is super equipped , Breakfasts and meals  by the pool,   just topsize!!!  Pool  size ideal, <br/>Same for the house which is very spacious, large bathroom, huge terrace with breathtaking views and  ideally located to discover the Cevennes , the  Gard , the Ardeche......<br/>Sylvain takes great care of his guests , he is  very discreet and available.<br/> Book with your eyes closed, you'll be delighted!!!!\",\"Superb spacious and clean villa, very nice view, beautiful moments around the beautiful pool and its fully equipped pool house.

         "[\"The place is very basic, it has all the basics but some aspects could be improved (wifi in the room, lounging area). However, breakfast was excellent (made by Abdulla’s mother) and the host is very kind and full of advice. Would recommend for a short stay.\",\"Staying at Abdulla's guesthouse was a wonderful period. He is very nice and a great host! After I showed him the activities I wanted to complete he helped organized and communicated with relevant agents to ensure a great experience. The breakfast was lovely and the staff was lovely. The location was perfect for my needs, I highly recommend his hotel to future guests!\",\"Great location, good value for money, would recommend for anyone looking for home from home\",\"Abdulla is a perfect host - very positive and helpful beyond our expectations. He helped us to find best diving centre in Nungwi, he recommended good restaurants and helped us with transport. We think, that he knows everyone in Nungwi ;)\\r<br/>His place is superclean, quiet and very relaxing. Super comfy bed, awesome bathroom. 5 minutes walk to small beach near turtles aquarium, 20 minutes walk to centre of village and more \\\"touristic\\\" area.\",\"Abdulla is a great host - very friendly, nice and helpful. Me and my friends had a great time there. And we loved the shower! Hot water and high water pressure is not that common on Zanzibar. The location is also great - only 5 minutes from the beach. If you are planning on staying in Nungwi I highly recommend Mwana house!\",\"Abdulla made me feel really welcome. Like others previous guests had mentioned he knows everyone and can help you save when it comes to excursions around Zanzibar. Rooms are spacious,clean  and you can have hot shower too. You can swim next with the sea turtles next door. Beach is only 2 min walk. I came to Zanzibar alone and made lots of friends through Abdulla. I really enjoyed my stay at mwana house. Thank you:)\",\"Abdulla's place was a short walk to the beach and thankfully tucked away from all the tourists resorts. Breakfast was simple, yet yummy and filling. Abdulla was easy to communicate with and always cheerful. He was super helpful and even arranged transportation from Stonetown to Nungwi.  (ask for the driver Omary who has great prices!) Thanks again, Abdulla!\",\"Abdulla was the perfect host. He made us feel welcome and at home, very obliging and helpful with lots of assistance and advice pertaining to restaurants and things to do that we really appreciated. He saved us quite a bit of money through his connections for a snorkelling trip which was awesome. He was very respectful and never over bearing. Even the cleaning lady Thumu was warm and welcoming. The establishment is rustic but well kept, neat and clean and very homely. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Mwana house. Asante sana Abdulla. :)\",\"Very good quality for the amount you pay: close to the beach, small shops just opposite the guesthouse. Abdulla was very welcoming and helpful. If you want to stay in a busy tourist area but still feel at home - this is your #1 choice! Thank you, Abdulla and hope to see you again!\",\"A nice room in a good guesthouse. Everything is clean and proper. Great place 3-5 minutes from the beach. Very close to local shops. \\r<br/>Abdulla was really nice and friendly, always tried to help me.  I really enjoyed my time here! I would highly recommend staying  at Mwana House.\\r<br/>\",\"We had a really nice stay at Mwana House. Abdulla was very friendly and helpful host. The place is located in quieter part of Nungwi with few restaurants around, couple of minutes from the local beach. Wish we could stay longer. I would definitely recommend it.\",\"Mwana house lives up to it's good reputation. Only 2 minutes walk to the beach. Outside Mwana, accross he street, are 2 convenient stores and a small cafeteria. Amazing staff. Safe neighborhood. I just love this place. \",\"Abdulla is a great host. He treats you like a friend and makes you feel at home. He can organize airport transfer and excursions, but compare prices with the people on the beach! Negotiate is a must on Zanzibar. It is very close to the beach, not the most beautiful beach but still very nice. It is a bit far away from Nungwi centre, with the restaurants and best beaches. (about 20 walk on the beach, but beautiful walk).\\r<br/>All in all, great value for money! Absolutely Recommendable.\\r<br/>Thanks Abdulla for our stay!\",\"Best choice for a real local staying in Nungwi. Far from the standard big resort, it is a local place, nice, tidy and clean to stay at. Located inside the village: closed to the Acquarium, the lighthouse and the fishermen place, you will need to walk 15 minutes to get to the more touristic beaches and restaurants\\r<br/>Breakfast and Wi-Fi are included and a snack shop is just in front of the place. Night guard and hot water in the room. We have been very happy with the 4 nights we spent at Abdulla' place also for his friendly and cheerful welcome. Recommended!\",\"I had a perfect stay at mwana house with my girlfriend. The room is confortable and big enoth for two persons, have a fan and in the bathroom we missed nothing. <br/>Abdulla was comme to pic us up at the airport (cheaper then the normal taxis) and he becomms our first person to talk for everything we need  for on the island. For this price i think it is a perfect place, if you see all the luxus resorts around. <br/>Thank you for everything Abdulla\",\"Abdulla was an excellent host. He really listened to our needs of traveling on a budget and was eager to arrange anything we needed. Breakfast was   great, he drove us into town and arranged a snorkeling trip for us. He has many contacts in the community and can use them to your advantage. The place is situated a very short walk to a nice beach that is not overrun with tourists or people trying to sell souvenirs. The property has fruit trees that you are welcome to and the room was large and comfortable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. \",\"Mwana house is an amazing place in Zanzibar. First of all, I felt safe, as this was my first time in Africa. I felt safe as I had the constant support from the owner Abdulla. The staff are nice, friendly and will try everything to ensure you are comfortable. Beach distance with a two minute walk and 15 minutes away to the busy beaches. Abdulla is amazing, very helpful, available and willing to cooperate in any matter. I recommend this place and thank Abdulla and all his staff in the Mwana house team. Asante Sana!\",\"Abdlulla is the MAN with a BIG open heart! Since the first day I feel like brother. Very kind, polite, joyful, ready to help/assist any time. We had great time together all days. That is the reason I was really sad to leave...\",\"Abdulla is super nice, friendly and respected man among the nungwi. You are going to be safe and well treated. The place is nice and cozy. The breakfast is simple but believe me (i eat a lot) it gets you through the day. I’d higly recomend Mwana house if you are not chasing luxury stuff but willing to interact with local  culture and different people around the world who’s staying Mwana house. Abdulla knows about best places to eat, chill, hang out and party. it was such a nice experience, i had new friends there and strongly suggest to stay in Mwana house at least for several days if you aren’t sure. If you are adventuares person like me you won’t regret! Thank you Abdulla, it was a real pleasure my friend!\",\"Abdulla was an amazing host, lots of communication and tips. Plus is always happy to help.<br/>Only problem was dodgy plug sockets, but got them to charge after a bit of fiddling.\",\"Abdulla is a friendly and helpful host who makes you feel welcome. Whatever questions you have, he answers quickly and if you need help or tips, he helps everytime and arranges everything. The bed was comfortable, the room was as described and breakfast was delicious.\",\"For those who are considering a place to stay in Zanzibar, look no further, Abdulla s place has it all. On top of his unparalleled hospitality and his willingness to go the extra 1 Thousand miles to make your stay memorable, Abdulla helped me even prior to my trip to sort out all logistics. His place has all what a traveller needs: Super clean, calm and big room, safe, great location, walking distance to the beach and nightlife spots, strong wifi and nice and varied Breakfast including a good selection of fruits. Definitely recommended.\",\"Mwana house is in a good location about a 10 minute walk from the north end of the beach. The room I had was large with its own bathroom and shower. There is a large mosquito net over the bed which was very effective in keeping me from being bitten, and the fan above the bed cooled the room somewhat. Abdullah was great at keeping in touch in the 3 month lead-up to my visit, also arranging pick up and drop off in Stone Town, and able to arrange almost anything I needed while there. He's also very personable with a great sense of humour, and interacts easily with his guests. It was nice to have a fridge to store snacks, fruit, left-overs and of course beer!! Thanks for a great stay, Abdullah!\",\"we had a pleasent stay and warm welcome at Abdulla\\\"s Mwana Guesthouse. which is located close to the beach,a short interesting walk through the village,real life of the local families and fishermen.  we enjoyed the friendly place and the kind of traveller you will meet there. Abdulla will help you with all your reqests.furthermore the staff ladies are friendly, rooms are clean, the breakfast(fruits and local baked bread) is fine.  <br/>quite a different individual place, compare to all these big resorts around Nungwi<br/>Ben and Romy / Munich\"]",

Just one detail...the GPS indicates in one location, and the location is across the street, we lose around five minutes searching for the correct location! This happened with another tbm house. But other than that, all excellent, the problem was the GPS!\",\"Very good place, it had been other times but never in season, I thought the hotel makes the space super crowded, there is no place to sit around the pools! The standard hotel room!\",\"Sensational!! Very good hotel structure, it was my wife and two children, they love… good pools, games room, recreation with monitors, restaurant, gym, cinema…. Apartamento Top, very cozy, found it very large, air-conditioned, clean and organized, all perfect!!! Township to Thermas dos Laranjais, market close by, Burguer King in the hotel structure, nearby Mc Donald, market and pharmacy nearby and several restaurants nearby tb. And the host Felipe, note 10 gave us all the attention and provided us with a wonderful apartment, we recommend and we'll be back for sure!!!\",\"I recommend the stay. Attentive host and location was as described, clean environment, great location and with leisure and dining options.\",\"The village meets the cost-benefit expectations for a resort, having very good facilities such as pools, toys, etc. The pools are well heated, there are attractions at all times. The restaurants and cafes are also good. The cleaning that leaves a little to be desired.<br/>But if you're looking for a quiet place, don't stay there. The amount of apartments/ condominiums is very high for the structure that holds it. Places in the pool are very busy, the elevators are always crowded, there are lines all the time to climb to the apartment. The noise of the avenue at night is also quite loud.<br/>The apartment is ok, but definitely not for 6 people. We were only left, me, my husband and my son, and in this case they served us well, but there are not 6 people in this apartment, there is space to sleep in the living room, on the sofa bed, but they would have to be two children, it would be very uncomfortable for two adults.\",\"Felipe was very attentive, passed along recommendations from the place, explained about Thermas that by the way it is on the side of the building and is wonderful. There is a train to take and pick up, several restaurants in the same building, the apartment served my family, has room service, towels, which helps a lot, nice and clean space, the building surprised us, I highly recommend it.\",\"Felipe is super attentive, answered all my questions super fast. The room is super comfortable. <br/>The cleaning of the hotel left to be desired, we stayed 6 nights and the room was not cleaned any day. The period I stayed in the hotel was packed, so to get a spot in the elevator it took about 10 minutes.\",\"I recommend it well clarified\",\"Felipe is an excellent host, our stay at the hotel was wonderful, we spent 4 days staying. The ap is organized, clean and spacious, the resort is complete and is well located with everything (markets,parks, pharmacies,MC Donald's, restaurant) nearby. It exceeded our expectations.\",\"Fellipe was a great host, always helpful, and the accommodations exceeded expectations, I recommend!\",\"Clean apartment, very cozy, wonderful resort, Felipe always very attentive, the stay was very good, I will come back more times for sure.\",\"I highly recommend, host Felipe very attentive, responds and answers all questions quickly. We'll definitely be back soon \uD83E\uDD70\",\"I have nothing to complain about. It was a great stay of 5 nights.\",\"good evening, we love our stay, the room is identical to the listing, clean, resort and top with recreation and fun for adults and children all day. Felipe and note ten, super attentive from the time I booked until check-out, he is always willing to answer questions, information at last I highly recommend it, even with the tickets to the park he helped us, I will come back more times and recommend his hosting for sure\",\"Felipe is great and I will definitely come back again\",\"Felipe very attentive, responded very quickly and answered all my questions. It was very thoughtful and I request to answer all my questions.<br/>Wonderful hotel with lots of recreation and lots of leisure! <br/>We went off season, so it was super quiet. <br/>Easy access to restaurants, bars, supermarket, pharmacy.<br/>I recommend, I hope to come back soon!\",\"We had an excellent experience from start to finish, the perfect apartment, very clean and well cared for.<br/>The listing perfectly matches what was found.<br/>We stayed in the two-bedroom apartment with two bathrooms, which served us perfectly.<br/>We'll be back !!\",\"Great stay.<br/>Very clean apartment.  Great place for a family of up to 5 people. <br/>Felipe makes a difference in service, very cordial, responds very quickly!\",\"Felipe mto attentive and wonderful hosting\",\"Great host, it even helped me with tickets... but for checkin arrive 1 hour before at least,  reception is very disorganized and bureaucratic... take units there at the top (to be able to take an elevator) or too low to go by stairs. <br/>Small and ALWAYS crowded elevators.<br/>Escape to correct\",\"Best experience we could have in Olympia. Simply wonderful, the room, hotel, cleanliness, safety for children, entertainment, super request host, value for money etc. We are in love with everything and already want to come back haha. See you soon!\",\"The hotel is very nice, with an excellent structure, and a great location, very close to Thermas dos Laranjais park, you can walk!!<br/>Felipe is a 10, he was very attentive, he answered us promptly, whenever we need him!!<br/>We'll definitely get back to you!!\",\"Felipe was an excellent host, always attentive and polite, and even kept communication with me at all times (before, during, and after their stay).<br/>The apartment is extremely cozy and accommodates 6 guests very well.<br/>The hotel is amazing and has many attractions, spa, game rooms, cinema, restaurants and bars, heated pools and several other attractions for all ages. <br/>Olympia's residents are also very attentive and polite, they have indicated several places for lunch and dinner. <br/>It was an amazing trip and undoubtedly unforgettable, we will definitely come back more often.\"]",

Quarteira is close enough to Faro that an Uber is cheap and the harbor of Vilamoura is walking distance for a boat trip along the seashores. All in all, this place was everything we needed!\",\"Very nice apartment,  close to the beach and in the center of Quarteira, Carlos welcomed us, we were even able to access the apartment before the arrival time. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our stay. Despite the fact that it does not have parking, parking was available and free nearby. Thank you Carlos for this stay and see you next time.\",\"the host is very accessible and  establishes an easy and direct dialogue. <br/>the apartment is not very nice,  it is very hot and has little lighting. it has fans on the ceiling of the bedrooms and the living room and has a mobile fan,  very noisy. The fans do not refresh the apartment, which has made the stay very unbearable. relative to the lighting,  the lights are very weak and emit yellow light, very unpleasant. The apartment is located on the 3* floor without elevator,  a chaos to climb either with the luggage, it wants without luggage.\",\"Checked in earlier, which was no problem at all. The stand can be seen directly from the window. Also, if something didn't work or you had questions, he responded within 20 minutes.\",\"July.2023<br/>Absolutely great location with a wonderful view of the beach from the bedroom balcony. The little balcony is perfect for morning coffee and an evening drink enjoying sunset.  The apartment was clean and spacious for a family of 4 (we were only 3).  Even though there isn’t AC the cross winds with all the windows open and the fans made it fresh. The walk to the 3rd floor with luggage can be a workout, but this is Europe \uD83D\uDE01.  Thank- you Carlos for a very pleasant stay  - definitely would book again.\",\"Carlos is a great host! Very responsive and helpful with the checking in and out! The apartment is located in the perfect spot, right near local restaurants and bars, and steps from the beach. Definitely recommend! Apartment was clean, wifi was fast, 10/10\",\"Lovely apartment by the beach, check in was very easy with Carlos who was very attentive and quick to respond to messages. Very good value!\",\"This apartment was in a great location, you can see a little bit of sea from the balcony and get the lovely sunset colours in the sky from across the road! Loads of restaurants and shops nearby and a lovely 15 minute walk to Vilamoura (a must!).<br/>Carlos is an excellent host, extremely responsive and friendly. He arranged the taxi for us both ways which was a big help. The only slight downside is one evening the apartment above was loud, banging doors, chairs etc and no carpets as it’s European. Otherwise it’s very quiet and clean! I would definitely stay again and highly recommend it.\",\"Simply great.<br/>Spectacular hosts.<br/>Super tidy and clean apartment.<br/>A 1-minute walk to the beach ( they have toys for the kids to take to the beach.)<br/>I am always available to answer the cell phone.<br/>The space is airy and the balcony although small it has a sea view.<br/>Bed linen and towels for everyone.<br/>Very considerate of our needs.<br/>There's free parking on the back of the building.<br/>It has a mini price at 5 minutes and intermarche and pharmacy 10 minutes away by foot.<br/>Would recommend.\",\"Everything worked out great, the apartment is as it is shown in the listing. Check-in was actually only possible from 4 pm, but we were allowed to check in earlier because the apartment was ready to move into and we found that extremely nice. The apartment is right at the beach, supermarkets, promenade and also easily accessible to the city within walking distance. All in all, a good stay and recommended.\",\"Second time I'm with Carlos and as previously reviewed: MEGA.  Carlos himself is super and helpful and uncomplicated. I am available at all times and with good tips in the Repertoir.<br/>I highly recommend and have already requested the next trip with him...<br/>Carlos, muito obrigado e até breve. Abraço, Cláudio\",\"Really lovely host- our flight was delayed and we ended up getting to the Airbnb much later than originally anticipated. Carlos was so kind to wait until quite late in the night for us. The flat is super clean, and well located. Everything in Quarteira within walking distance. Thank you \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFC\",\"This place was a great deal and looked just like the pictures. Location was great and Carlos is an excellent host. The neighborhood was a bit noisy, but it felt safe and welcoming. Kitchen was well stocked and clean. Overall, an awesome stay.\",\"Very clean apartment, on the water with all amenities, perfect for a lazy stay\uD83D\uDE0E. A big thank you to our host Carlos for his kindness. We recommend it! (and will definitely go back\uD83D\uDE03)\",\"Great location and apartment. Was everything we could have asked for and more. Highly recommend.\",\"Very good stay. The apartment is at the foot of the beach. Very clean and as described.<br/>I recommend you for a journey in faro.<br/>The host is very welcoming.\",\"very close to the beach, to markets and restaurants.<br/>comfy beds, plenty of space, and a full bath.<br/>the host is very friendly. I'm present.\",\"We had a great time in Quarteira. We loved the apartment, everything was very comfortable, clean, organized and Carlos was very nice and helped us with whatever we needed. The Supermarket is on the corner, the beach is even closer, and there are good restaurants around. Location could not be better. Highly recommended!\",\"Carlos was an amazing host throughout our stay in his Airbnb. He adapted to our needs and made sure everything went nice and smooth. <br/>The flat itself is great, less than a minute away from the beach and with a lot of shops/restaurants/supermarkets around.<br/>You're also only 15/20 minutes walk away from Vilamoura and the walk is very pretty!<br/>Can't recommend enough, hope to be there again soon!!\",\"Excellent host...<br/>impeccable apartment.<br/>Thanks for the great stay\",\"Carlos is a very kind and helpful guy. The appartement was exactly like on the pictures. Open on both sides so you can make it as airy as you like. With a nice balcony on the west side, where you can relax and enjoy the sunset. You can see hear and smell the see on the balcony.  On Wednesdays there is local fruit/veggies/and other stuff-market right next to the appartement. Carlos even arranged a pick-up at the airport for me which saved me time and money. He arranged the transport back to the airport as well so I didn't have to stress to get to the airport at 6am. Thanks Carlos, I enjoyed my stay and will be back soon hopefully :)\",\"Had a great time at this very well located apartment. Carlos was extremely helpful - meeting us at midnight and letting us check out late for free as the apartment was empty the following night. Seems like he would always go out of his way to help!\",\"Carlos is a super friendly man who takes care of everything with attention, helpfulness and care. Help is no problem if needed and also took care of the transfer to the airport.<br/>The apartment is mega clean, good layout with extra bedroom and a view of the sea from the balcony, which is 100 m away. Restaurants, bars and shopping within walking distance in a minute. Also the nearest place (Vilamoura) is 10 minutes away on foot. It is fully equipped with everything.<br/>Carlos: We thank you for your hospitality and felt extremely good the week with you. We will definitely visit again\uD83E\uDD70\",\"Carlos was very welcoming, the apartment is very located a few meters from the beach and shops. 4 real places in very comfortable beds. We had a lovely stay!\"]",

The area was very close to historical places and the place is in the central area, Yilmaz hosted us very well and the baklava and Turkish delight surprise made us very happy. Thank you for everything, we will come back again\",\"A great location in the old city. Walk to all the major city highlights and great local restaurants. With the perfect host\",\"Apartment well located for exploring Istanbul. Very responsive host, very accommodating.\",\"I came with my family, the apartment met our needs, everything in the kitchen <br/>there was a bathroom and the apartment was clean <br/>the living room was stylish and modernly decorated, you can stay without a second thought <br/>everything was great\",\"I would highly recommend this host and flat! It was great experience to visit Istanbul with my family! Flat is really close to old city, tram & metro station! Many great restaurants, shops around and If you want walk on coast It’s just few meters. Flat was exacly the same as on pics, clean and had whole stuff. Great communication - host always care, answer my message and help If needed! Also we get a lot recomendation about city, transport, restaurants, monuments and everything  to enjoy our visit for 100%!\",\"Yilmaz was so kind as to meet us at 2am. He communicated whenever we needed advice and gave us lots of helpful tips. The apartment is well located in an  interesting area with supermarkets cafes and restaurants and 10 mins walk to the historical centre. Our transfers to and from the airport went smoothly, thanks to Yilmaz. We'll be back \uD83D\uDC95\",\"Yilmaz arranged an amazing stay from the beginning till the end from arranging the pick from Airport till dropping us back was well organised for the price we paid for the transport seperately. the house is neatly kept and the neighbourhood is good too we stayed with our daugher who is 13 and son 12 - was very safe for families to stay and the provisions was enough for the stay. The kitchen and the bathroom could be much more groomed . The rooms are well kept and enough space and etc small room worked well to keep our luggages. I would recommend this place for stay for any of my friends\",\"Thanks to our hosts for their warm hosting and availability!<br/>Apartment matches the photos close to major tourist sites. <br/>I would recommend it.\",\"Nice cozy and clean apartment. Nothing too fancy but very conveniently located. Within walking distance from many tourist attractions. The apparent manager was responsive and thoughtful. Overall, a nice experience.\",\"Great place friendly hosts. They have bathroom shower essentials. they were so sweet and brought Turkish desserts. the place was clean and so close to ayasophia and the blue mosque.\",\"Great Airbnb! The property itself is very central and perfect for visiting all the sights of Sultanahmet. The host was kind, welcoming and even left us a box of Turkish delight. Would definitely stay again.\",\"We had a very good time, he was very kind for the flexibility of check-out\",\"Yilmaz was an excellent, proactive host that helped us from the moment we landed in Istanbul to the day we left. He was always available to arrange transport if necessary, provide anything that wasn't in the apartment, and even left us very thoughtful gifts throughout our stay.<br/>All four beds were fitted with spotless sheets, pillows, and mattress toppers when we arrived, and the kitchen and bathroom were both clean and in good working order. The location is within walking distance of Sultanahmet Square and all of its associated attractions, in addition to countless local eateries and a small supermarket.<br/>The apartment does face onto a noisy street and overlooks a park at the rear with a floodlight, so there was a little traffic noise/light at night that light sleepers should be aware of (though redundant considering the morning call to prayer.) <br/>Overall, the apartment was definitely worth the very affordable price and served as a great home-base while exploring the city.\",\"I’m sorry but this apartment is falling apart. It was very noisy, the furniture is old and broken. There are stains in the shower. I been to a lot of Airbnb and I do not recommend this stay.\",\"a very nicely located place, with a view and excellent attention\",\"Location is good, apartment a little disappointing as it need to be updated/renovated.<br/>Hosts were very nice and helpful which made our stay a little more pleasant,\",\"The apartment was spacious and airy and Ismail, the apartment manager was friendly and helpful.<br/>It was perfect place for the 4 of us to relax after a day of sightseeing.\",\"Yilmaz was a very friendly and responsive host. The apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to many restaurants and the old town is close by. Yilmaz provided local recommendations for dining and sightseeing, which was very helpful.<br/>Just a word about the noise in the apartment...  The front bedroom is a little noisy, but it is on street level, so this is to be expected. However, the smaller 3rd bedroom had the water heater in it and this unfortunately made noise during the night.<br/>Overall our stay was quite pleasant.\",\"Location is good, host was so helpful and communicative that you can’t even imagine, flat itself was good, especially beds it was unreal comfort.<br/>Yilmaz helped with our luggage , he helped to keep it in warehouse after check out and even organized transfer from apartment to airport, <br/>Thanks so much Yilmaz, best wishes\",\"excellent everything highly recommend.\",\"Apartment is very well located in relation to the main tourist sites, in a popular and typical neighborhood.<br/>The kitchen is quite outdated, is summarily equipped both in terms of appliances and dishes. Not all of the advertised amenities are there.<br/>Our host did not introduce us to all the amenities ( especially those located outside the apartment) and were not responsive to our requests.<br/>Only 2 out of 3 bedrooms are air-conditioned and the bedroom on the street is very noisy.\",\"Nice and lovely host and very nice and cozy house\",\"It was an accommodation where you can see the sea and Sultan Ahmet Mosque at the same time. Originally it was on the first floor, but the host was assigned to the 4th floor as a suggestion, so the scenery was better. It is easy to get around with sightseeing spots that are close by walking. The hosts were very hospitable, were actively available and responsive. He is a great host in a great city.\",\"Great place to stay that is within walking distance to many historical sites and great restaurants in Kumkapı. Yılmaz went above and beyond in arranging our transport needs and help us find places suitable to our interests. 10/10 definitely recommend it.\"]",

As for the drawbacks, I'll note that the heater in the bathroom was not working, but it's not critical.<br/>There's a good café nearby where you can have a delicious breakfast. Detailed instructions on how to find the chalet were provided before our arrival, so it wasn't difficult to get there. Tanja is a responsive and hospitable host. Thank you!\",\"I stayed at Tanja's place for 7 nights.  If you want a good night sleep this is the place to be since the area is very quiet. The apartment is warm, clean and has a fully equiped kitchen if you want to cook. If someday they build the gondola that should go up to the ski resort, this will be the perfect place to stay.\",\"Good apartment near the Kopaonik. Theoretically it is possible to ski almost near it.  I did not try but a lot of people skied there. Kopaonik is not so far but in ,it may take 30 min to go there by car. It depends on the weather conditions.<br/>Apartment is small but the size is OK for two people. It contains everything that u may need for stay. So it is a good choose if u have a car and want to save money.\",\"Tanja’s apartment is a good value for the price if you want to go skiing in Kopaonik. Located about 20 minutes drive up the hill to the center of the ski slopes, the appartment is surrounded by the mountains in a quiet area. If you arrive by car, make sure to bring your snow chain, as driving to the apartment can be challenging sometimes... :)<br/>Also be aware that there are a lot of stairs you have to climb to get to the apartment, which are usually covered in snow and ice, so you have to be very careful with your steps.<br/>Tanja was very helpful and she always replied immediately to our questions. Altogether we were very satisfied with the apartment. <br/>Thank you, Tanja! :)\",\"Plus:<br/>Very good value for money. Location is fantastic. Kitchen has all necessary things that we needed.<br/>Tanja is very friendly and professional host.<br/>Minus: <br/>The bed in the bedroom is very hard. I have back pain so it was very uncomfortable for me. <br/>It wasn’t perfectly clean. It should be cleaner.\",\"I like the villa location, it’s with good views, the parking lot nearby the villa, the house equipped 14’ LCD TV, the bed need guest DIY, if it’s ready when guest coming that’s great!\",\"Perfect place to stay. Very helpful owner.\",\"The location is ok, although at the foot of the hill.There is a cable car at the door, but we went without driving.We are rushing from the capital. I personally feel that it is good at the foot of the homestay at the foot of the mountain. The next day, we will go to the snow mountain for half an hour. If the homestay is directly on the mountain, it is dangerous to go to the snow mountain at night.The host also helped us contact the instructor, but finally didn't ask for a trainer because the child was sick.\",\"Phenomenal, clean, and quiet place. Enjoying bass. <br/>You arrive at the very center of the bath in about 30 minutes. <br/>All recommendations! <br/>The landlady is a lovely and positive woman \uD83D\uDE0A\"]",

The bedroom was also very quiet and we had no problems sleeping through the night. <br/>As noted in other reviews, it is on the top floor of the building and there isn’t an elevator.

Conveniently located in Sarajevo city centre so everything is walking distance. Rialda’s instructions for check in and check out were crystal clear and was happy to help with anything. Coffee, tea and other amenities were provided. <br/>Only negative note I have is there is no elevator and the apartment is located on the top floor. This wasn’t a problem for us but for others it may be. <br/>I would definitely stay here again ❤️\",\"Great cozy apartment in the very heart of the city. <br/>Apartment was clean, well equipped and nicely decorated. <br/>The bed was very comfy, although I would change the pillows, since the one they’ve got are too soft and hight. <br/>Smart TV was not working for some reason, but there was an HDMI cable.

Located in the center of Midtown just  hundred meters from the Cathedral and walking distance of Old Town. A Nice place with a kitchen and bathroom full of equipment, and a big livingroom. The livingroom and bedroom have airconditioning which is really nice since summer can be very hot in Sarajevo. The shower was not so great on the other hand and the apartment is located on the top floor without an elevator. So you’ll need to take the stairs. But in the old center that is a common thing when you stay in a monumental building. It also has its charm. The host is great, only ask and she will fix anything for you. I would reccomend this place for sure!\",\"Everything was perfect. I didn't think that we will be so pleased. Perfect hosting and a beautiful place. The location is so central.

Good place, centre, near shops, park, cafe\",\"It's really hard to find a better location in Sarajevo. Rialda's apartment is located in the very center of Sarajevo, with great restaurants, cafés, bars and landmarks right around the corner. The apartment itself was really clean and nice with all amenities we could ask for, even traveling with our two-year-old. Rialda was a great host, always available to help out with any questions. Also, a small but perhaps important note: the wi-fi in the apartment was really good.\",\"Very good location and nice place \uD83D\uDC4C\",\"Would recommend to anyone who is visiting Sarajevo\",\"Rialda’s apartment was awesome. I can’t imagime any better location for a downtown apartment in a capital. Parking just on the other side of the street. Main street is just 10 seconds from the door. Rialda was very kind. Thank you!\",\"Great apartment on even better location! There are a lot of stuff in apartment that we haven’t excpected to be there, such as coffe machine and tea, which was pleasant surprise.<br/>Don’t be fooled by the building entrance, this apartment is among the best out there! <br/>10/10\",\"Beautiful, very clean and well equipped apartment. The best location, in center of Sarajevo old town just a few seconds from everything. Everything is well organized and a host Rialda responding very fast on every question.  She left us bottle of wine for welcoming. Great experience\",\"We stayed in Sarajevo with a family of 4 and we really liked this apartment. It is much better than in the photos, located in the very center, on a tourist pedestrian street, but at the same time it is very quiet - you can't hear the sounds of the street at all. The apartment is equipped with everything you need - coffee, several varieties of tea, all appliances are fresh, the bathroom also has everything you need. Literally a stone's throw from the apartment there is a great pastry shop, a chic cormorant shop and the best ¥evabdžinica in town )<br/>Separately, I want to thank Rialda for allowing us to check in early after a sleepless night and check out later before the return trip. It literally saved us! If we find ourselves in Sarajevo again, we will definitely stay here.\",\"If this place is available, do yourself a favor and book it: you won't do better in Sarajevo.<br/>Perfect location, well equipped, warm (in the winter), very comfortable.

         "Hisa Gradnikova... a quaint 1850's renovated stone cottage, in the heart of Tolmin old centre, and full of rustic charm. A curvy exterior, built around one of the tiny side streets of the old town.   Our house is steeped in history, and is shown multiple times with old photos in the town centre of Tolmin.Our house is ideally located less than 850m from the festival venue in Tolmin..punk rock, metal days, reggae & the soca river, ideal for water sports enthusiasts, hikers and paragliding.The spaceThe house if fantastically located in the centre of Tolmin and walking distance to the festivals, for example metal days/punk/reggae are just 850m walking. It is ideal if you do not want to have a car. There are many restaurants and bars all within walking distance, as well as various shops and a supermarket. The beach area is also 850m walk. The national park and gorges are 2km away.Our house is one of the closest rental properties you can get to the beautiful Soca Valley river in Tolmin, where the festivals and water activities take place, and where you access the river by walking down the the Dijaška Ulica road. It's location means  you can walk to all the amenities; supermarkets, bars, and restaurants, and beach area.. A modern kitchen and dining area, with table and seating for 5,  hob, oven,  as well as a log burner with an exposed chimney flu.. There is additionally a  downstairs cloakroom/utility.Upstairs there are two bedrooms, one with its  own ensuite shower room, and another shower room, both with underfloor heating.  There is a further mezzanine level in the attic with 1 single bed . This attic  is a low level ceiling great for older children; however you cannot stand up in it, so unsuitable for adults. This attic  level is also unsuitable for toddlers or very small children, due to the stairs being very steep, and also a toddler or small child could climb in between the bannisters.You will see that our house is made of natural 1850's year old stone, with it being exposed in many places. And whilst the house does  get dusty due to the natural stone walls breathing, we have installed the Mitsubishi M Series fur heating and air conditioning. This system has air purification through advanced V blocking  filter, neutralising bacteria, viruses, allergens, dust and mould.  This also works via an efficient heat pump to help us contribute to the sustainability targets in each country. There is solid 1850's original wooden flooring throughout the upper level.TV works the internet.If you are expecting a modern house, with smooth straight edges, and clinically clean like a hospital, don't book this house!

         "[\"Everything was great!<br/>The host, Linda, was very helpful and easy to communicate, really pleasant and smooth experience. Place itself was great too, a lot of space and a very good location.<br/>Would love to stay here next time.\",\"As a festival visitor, the location was ideal for this. Communication was top notch and everything worked out well. Had everything you needed. Unfortunately, it was not thoroughly cleaned, even if you are not sensitive and do not have great requirements. Although the house is old, this should be possible. It had a lot of cobwebs, even in places where it is very visible and you move a lot (door, balcony, etc.). Otherwise everything is ok so far.\",\"nice house, good location, super easy check-in/out, good communication. nice overall experience.\",\"A beautiful home steeped in history but with modern comforts. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the location in tomlin is ideal for walking to shops, cafes, restaurants, tourist info and the beaches. Linda was an attentive and helpful host with some great tips to enhance our stay. we would live to return as a family and stay for longer next time\",\"Linda's house was perfectly located for both the shops and restaurants in Tolmin as well as the festival we were attending by the river. The house is really spacious inside with plenty space for 4 of us to sleep, relax, eat and so on. It's got a lot of rustic charm and Linda made the whole process of checking in and out really simple.\",\"The house is spacious, having now an electric grill, fully equipped and comfy 2 bedrooms, the third room on the top (3beds) are mostly okay only to go to sleep or for short people, or children as the ceiling is around 150CM tall. It was very easy to communicate with Linda, who always responded promptly. The check-in was easy even remotely. The location is central, which we liked a lot and you could find free parking space not too far as well. <br/>The cleanness was just 4 starts from 5, and we are not picky. The bathrooms were not super clean, but we could live with that. Be careful that the waste needs to be selectively collected, but there is only one bin, and you can not dispose of it mixed anywhere in the city. There is a public collection point near the bakery at the parking places, within walkable distance. Also if you did not know there are scorpions in Slovenia. We found one inside on the first night, not dangerous though. At least according to the internet. The top room, or more like an open space as it has no doors, is warm, and not too comfortable for adults. Mostly for children as the ceiling is low, but okay to just go to sleep. <br/>The Living room and the kitchen is perfect for gathering cooking and grilling with a new electric grill at the terrace. We loved it and made dinner several nights. The house next door is being renovated inside, which can cause some noise for the next 2-3 months if you sleep with windows open expect to be woken around 7-7:30.\",\"We were three guys staying at Linda's place for a week during Metaldays 2018. We just loved the place. We couldn't have had a better location for our purpose. Less than a kilometer walking distance to the festival area. Everything was exactly as expected and described by the host. Communication between ourselves and the host was excellent from the start. Highly recommended :)<br/>Hans, 53, from Norway\",\"great place to stay.\",\"We spent nice days in Tolmin. The house  is very lovely to stay and you can reach several destinations in rather short  time. I like very much the style of the House and felt at home very quick. Thanx for the reduced way of renovating-itś calming.\",\"I booked this apartment through Airbnb for a holiday with my children. The place was more like a cellar than a house, and the cleaning was extremely Inadequate. There were spider webs, dust. In the kitchen the walls were black and dirty with an unknown substance. Spider webs were in all of the fans, dust on the curtains, the toilet brush in the bathroom was black, and black mold was on the floor of one of the showers. I am concerned that two of the heaters had asbestos. On the table outside the ashtray was still dirty, and neither me or my kids smoke. Some spots on the floor were impossible to walk on because of the broken wood (my son fell down because of this) and cords were exposed near the television. The bathrooms and showers were so small that it was difficult for a taller person to shower, and heavy winter sheets were put on one of the beds in the middle of August! It was 40 degrees celsius inside of the house, and when i asked for lighter sheets i was given grey sheets instead of white. Half of the lightbulbs were blown out in one of the hanging lights. My daughter even had an allergy attack due to the amount of dust. Booking this house ruined my holiday and I would not recommend it to anyone... I think that airbnb has to cancell this listing, to avoid that other guests have the same bad surprise... My holiday has been ruined!!!!!! I think that this apartment is a fraud.\",\"Everything as expected, nice house. Perfectly placed for Punk Rock Holiday festival, would stay here again!\",\"A very nice house in the centre of Tolmin. We had a great time and would definitely recommend this house. Excellent communication from the host as well!\",\"Linda was super nice, the location was cool furs Butik festival but the place was not very clean\",\"Beautifully renovated appartment. Located in the characteristic old center of Tolmin. \",\"Great location!\",\"A great accommodation with everything you need and space for four with two bedrooms each with its own bathroom. Great hosts who responded quickly. Very happy to come back.\"]",

A curvy exterior, built around one of the tiny side streets of the old town.   Our house is steeped in history, and is shown multiple times with old photos in the town centre of Tolmin.Our house is ideally located less than 850m from the festival venue in Tolmin..punk rock, metal days, reggae & the soca river, ideal for water sports enthusiasts, hikers and paragliding.\"},{\"title\":\"The space\",\"value\":\"The house if fantastically located in the centre of Tolmin and walking distance to the festivals, for example metal days/punk/reggae are just 850m walking. It is ideal if you do not want to have a car. There are many restaurants and bars all within walking distance, as well as various shops and a supermarket. The beach area is also 850m walk. The national park and gorges are 2km away.Our house is one of the closest rental properties you can get to the beautiful Soca Valley river in Tolmin, where the festivals and water activities take place, and where you access the river by walking down the the Dijaška Ulica road. It's location means  you can walk to all the amenities; supermarkets, bars, and restaurants, and beach area.. A modern kitchen and dining area, with table and seating for 5,  hob, oven,  as well as a log burner with an exposed chimney flu.. There is additionally a  downstairs cloakroom/utility.Upstairs there are two bedrooms, one with its  own ensuite shower room, and another shower room, both with underfloor heating.  There is a further mezzanine level in the attic with 1 single bed . This attic  is a low level ceiling great for older children; however you cannot stand up in it, so unsuitable for adults. This attic  level is also unsuitable for toddlers or very small children, due to the stairs being very steep, and also a toddler or small child could climb in between the bannisters.You will see that our house is made of natural 1850's year old stone, with it being exposed in many places. And whilst the house does  get dusty due to the natural stone walls breathing, we have installed the Mitsubishi M Series fur heating and air conditioning. This system has air purification through advanced V blocking  filter, neutralising bacteria, viruses, allergens, dust and mould.

Our house is steeped in history, and is shown multiple times with old photos in the town centre of Tolmin.\n<br>\n<br>\nOur house is ideally located less than 850m from the festival venue in Tolmin..punk rock, metal days, reggae &amp; the soca river, ideal for water sports enthusiasts, hikers and paragliding.\n<br>\n<br>\n<span class=\"_g5uevq\">The space</span>\n<br>\nThe house if fantastically located in the centre of Tolmin and walking distance to the festivals, for example metal days/punk/reggae are just 850m walking. It is ideal if you do not want to have a car. There are many restaurants and bars all within walking distance, as well as various shops and a supermarket. The beach area is also 850m walk. The national park and gorges are 2km away.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nOur house is one of the closest rental properties you can get to the beautiful Soca Valley river in Tolmin, where the festivals and water activities take place, and where you access the river by walking down the the Dija&#x161;ka Ulica road.

This attic  is a low level ceiling great for older children; however you cannot stand up in it, so unsuitable for adults. This attic  level is also unsuitable for toddlers or very small children, due to the stairs being very steep, and also a toddler or small child could climb in between the bannisters.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou will see that our house is made of natural 1850&apos;s year old stone, with it being exposed in many places.

         "[\"We absolutely loved our stay at Luana & Maurizio's Trastevere apartment. We were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness and homely quality of the apartment. It felt like staying at a family member's house! Everything was clean and we had access to everything we needed during our stay. Their apartment design is down to the details, there are even umbrellas for rainy weather. We would definitely rebook this lovely apartment next time we visit Rome.\",\"Very nice and pretty apartment in a vibrant area in Rom! We really enjoyed our stay and felt at home. <br/>Luana was a great host! Besides our last minute booking she arranged an earlier check-in. We would love to stay there another time. Thank you\",\"I had a wonderful experience in this apartment. <br/>I felt at home, a cozy, clean and well equipped apartment near the best restaurants of Rome, and a pleasant walk distance to the city’s main touristic attractions.<br/>I would happily come back again in my next visit to Rome :) thanks Luana and Maurizio!\",\"Great location at the edge of town.\",\"Communication from Luana and Maurizio was fantastic-they were quick to answer queries prior to booking and were very helpful and prompt in replying to further messages. The apartment was beautiful and location was great-it is close to lots of local bars, restaurants and shops, and only a 30min walk from the main attractions. Thank you very much for a really enjoyable stay.\",\"Luana and Maurizio could not have been more helpful. They responded really quickly when we asked about something. The flat is just how it appears on the pictures. It was very clean. A previous review said that the street was quiet, when we were there there was noise from a bar, but don't let that put you off. Unless you are a very light sleeper it's ok and the flat is very good to stay in. We walked to most places from the flat without having to go too far. I would stay again.\",\"Location was great, live music, wonderful food close by, gelato next door, beautiful walks through a gorgeous city, taxi stands a block away, views out the windows. It was great. Our host were the best with options and suggestions, very prompt and helpful. Check out the bathroom chandelier, I loved it. Thank you for a wonderful visit.\",\"A 10<br/>Everything!!!!\",\"Luana & Maurizio were fabulous hosts!  They responded immediately to any question, met us upon our arrival and departure to ensure everything went smoothly, and were most helpful with transportation logistics, sightseeing and restaurant recommendations.  We loved their sunny, clean home!  We would do it again.  Bravo!\",\"No complaints, everything went perfectly well, we didn't fully enjoy our stay. In addition, the place is on the edge of a lively and fun neighborhood.\",\"Luana & Maurizio’s place was everything that we were looking for!! I was fulfilling a promise to my 72 year old mother, to bring her to the Vatican and get some Roma flavor too, and our stay at Casa Rossi made our trip super easy and enjoyable. Even before booking they replied with the best intentions about my mom’s needs (not too many stairs, accessible for elderly, etc). So I felt confident about booking and I didn’t regret a bit! They were super helpful and kind in each of our exchanges. The house felt like home as we found everything we could possibly need. My mom was particularly happy with the super clean and well equipped kitchen. I was also super happy with their flexibility with check in and check out. Very considerate about our requests and also super approachable. Highly recommended!\",\"Great location and the<br/>apartment is equipped with everything!! 100% Recommended.\",\"Laura and Maurizio's place was just what we wanted - comfortable, well-equipped, and right in the midst of the Trastavere walking area. On a high floor with a good view, reached by an antique but functioning elevator. We would definitely stay again.\",\"Luana was just great and her space is very cute and clean! We really enjoyed our stay and she helped us numerous times with transportation and calling for taxis etc. We loved the area and all her food recommendations, especially the pastry shop!! Thank you so much Luana!❤️\",\"Really nice, big place. Perfect location for exploring Trastevere. Super clean and very responsive, communicative host.\",\"Lovely place and great location!\",\"The place is complete in all respects.

The hosts were absolutely lovely and check-in checkout was seamless. <br/>Book it Fasttt..\",\"Luana & Maurizio’s place was perfect! My good friend Lauren and I checked in with ease and were given a personal tour by lovely Luana. The place was spotless! They left us a variety of snacks, water, and local recommendations for our 4 night stay. The unit was much bigger than we had expected with two separate bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, and a living area. The surrounding neighborhood provided us with a local experience-small shops, bars, public transportation and restaurants. We loved our stay and will recommend it to all of our traveler friends!\",\"Great property and great hosts. Communication was excellent, prompt and helpful. Felt the hosts went out of their way to be accommodating.  The location for us was perfect. Walking distance to everything we we were there for including public transportation, restaurants, groceries and historical monuments. Great starting point for each days activities. Highly recommend.\",\"Both Luana and Maurizio were gracious and met us for check -in. The apartment has all the amenities needed to make for a comfortable stay (especially AC). The location of the apartment is ideal and I walking distance to just about every major site in the city of Rome. I would definitely stay here again.\",\"Luana is such a kind and thoughtful host.  She was very responsive and met us at the door with a smile.  The home is clean and bright.  It is so dreamy, with great views and great style.  There are so many thoughtful touches including a well stocked kitchen and portable wifi.  I truly loved staying here and almost found it tempting to stay inside as it felt so wonderful in their home!\",\"We had a lovely stay. The apartment is very well located in a great little street. The apartment is comfortable and as described. Our hosts were also great communicators and happy to answer any questions. The beds were a little uncomfortable, and the bath/shower inpracticle. Nevertheless great value for money in a trendy part of town.\",\"Our host met us on our arrival and graciously let us check in early.<br/>The apartment is beautifully furnished. The kitchen is well stocked with food and drinks.  The beds are very comfortable. <br/>Our hosts provided us with slippers and a portable WiFi for when we were out and about. <br/>The apartment is located in a vibrant neighborhood where the laughter and singing can be heard in the early morning hours on weekends. There are countless good restaurants in the immediate area and a great coffee shop just a few steps away.\",\"Location, location, location!!!! This is an entire apartment that is centrally located in Trastevere. You can walk everywhere from this location. It is filled with every amenity possible and more, including breakfast. Very clean, spacious and cute. Luana was  an outstanding host, she was helpful and attentive and suggested great places to check out. I’d strongly recommend it and would stay here again.

         "[\"The stay was good, Silvio took our doubts.. <br/>Móveis were okay, there's air conditioning, swimming pool (we didn't get to use it because we stayed more out of the apartment, in shores) the center and other beaches only make it worth driving, but it's not far away. We like the environment and we think about renting again.<br/>note: Only negative point is that they ask us to leave earlier than the contracted time, we left 1h earlier. pq would clean the apartment for another family.\",\"Great apto! We'll be back for sure! The condominium is very nice, has all the infra you need for the beach! I took my cat, I had no problem, there is a screen in all the windows. Comfortable, clean, the unit faces the pool, in short, we are already planning to return to Ubatuba and stay in the same apartment.\",\"The sugar from the kitchen dirty, bathroom comes out water under the box I'm all wet, they don't leave the minimum cleaning product, no dishcloth, they leave 2 floor cloth if you need no more, horrible old couch, bad couple mattress too soft old at last the only good thing is 9 air conditioning, they need a lot of improvements I've been in Ap in the same Condominium and much better.\",\"The apartment was in perfect condition, the condominium was very cozy, also clean and well maintained, we had no setbacks, everything was perfect from our arrival until we left.<br/>Aline was always attentive to our messages, she was cordial, generous, we are grateful!\",\"I always go to the Passaredo condominium, Aline is always very nice to us, we've been renting only with her for about 4 years, I love this condominium, and this time it was also very cool in Silvio's apartment, thanks for the stay, I already want to go back!\",\"Aline always very active, gave us good tips and always responds quickly… I also help in anticipating the checkin . It is already the third time we have been in this condominium, very good for those who have children.  Apto is excellent .. we feel at home once again \uD83D\uDE4F<br/>Thank\",\"In the kitchen there was no refractory with a lid to store the groceries, there were no mats to dry my feet, I went to contest with the broker, she informed that she had 2 of plastic, and the bathroom leaks water from inside the box out. The bachelor mattresses are foams that feel the floor. I went on vacation for the second time at the same time, but this time I left disappointed, almost 3,000 for a week of nervousness. I won't come back!\",\"Our  stay was wonderful,within the expected I and my family, the condominium presents good security,  co-host Aline responds quickly, passing the necessary guidelines, close to the market, bakery that could go walking . All by listing, condominium with several swimming pools, game room, covered parking next to the elevator . We like it and  we intend to return, it was worth it!\",\"perfect apartment..

Another thing that is critical for us is to be Petfriendly.\",\"We love the Apartamento. fit 8 people. air-conditioning working perfectly. We very much like the condominium, very quiet, there is no mess, well organized. The pools are great.\",\"It was good, I just didn't like the pressure to get out. The hostess had warned that the checkout was at 12:00, but I was with young children and it took me a while to get out. It could have a higher tolerance for checkout. The housekeeper arrived at noon on point and we had to leave in despair. That was very unpleasant. At least 30 minutes of tolerance should be given at least 30 minutes of tolerance, mainly taking into account being with young children.<br/>Another thing I didn't like very much was that the suite is for the bedroom that has the bunk beds and not the bedroom that has the double bed. The couple has to use the social bathroom. Something bypassable, but it's good to know in advance if the couple wants privacy.<br/>The rest is fine.\",\"Thanks Aline for your hospitality. <br/>we sincerely thank you for all clarity and agility in our conversations.  we recommend staying both in the app and for friends and family. <br/>#Super indico!! <br/>great day for you.\",\"Very handsome apartment with elevator , slightly old stove, torn sofa, slightly dirty barbecue, old laundry room, extremely uncomfortable couple mattress.<br/>Apartamento is in front of the pool much noise of both conversation and water as it has a house.

It is not feasible to stay on the beach where it is located, plus the same very close by . There is no flexibility at check in or at checkout. <br/>Extremely educated local staff . Organized and clean condominium. <br/>Very polite Aline answered me promptly every question. <br/>I wouldn't go back in the neighborhood because I didn't like it .\",\"Very cozy apto, calm to rest and enjoy!

There are nice beaches, restaurants, promenades nearby with amazing breakfasts and lunches. The host is very helpful and friendly! Highly recommended!\",\"You can walk around. The view is beautiful. The kitchen was empty, there was no tea and refreshments as shown in the photos.\",\"Everything was perfect just no ventilation in the shower and it's a rope maybe you can install a Venta and everything will be fine we had a great time.\",\"The space was identical to the description and comfortable , if you want to walk in the surrounding area it will be all around you you don't need a taxi or rent a car\",\"Good\",\"Absolutely loved this sunny, cozy, well-located apartment, equipped with everything you might need. There was an issue on day 1,  which the host solved in no time. I'll definitely keep this place in mind during my next visit to Batumi.\",\"Overall, it was fine. The furniture is a bit worn out, and there's some mold in the bathroom. The toiletries aren't the freshest. However, the decor is nice, and the location and price are excellent.\",\"Great apartment with a beautiful view from the window, warm, cozy, you can always contact the host. I recommend it!\",\"Thank you so much!!! Everything went great!!!\",\"The building is in a very central spot<br/>I came to 15 from the airport with the bolt application that is very easy to access, the apartment was on the 11th floor, it has a very comfortable area with an open kitchen, a bathroom, a large washing machine, there is a refrigerator, the kitchen and the counter are very sufficient, the materials are heated with enough air conditioning in the kitchen, although it was winter, I did not have any problems at all, two 3 minutes by walking to the beach, very close to the Nino statue, the alphabet tower<br/>There is a bar nearby called chacha Time<br/>There are many places that you can have breakfast and coffee<br/>The house is clean<br/>Bathroom clean<br/>It's time for the towels to change<br/>The elevators are small but fast<br/>I didn't wait during the winter<br/>It was a nice experience<br/>Thanks\",\"The view is amazing, and you can even enjoy it when falling asleep and waking up, from the bed\"]",

         "Free/ discounted events all year. Message for details of what's on before you book.One of 10 Self Catering  cottages. Facilities include: shared indoor heated pool and garden/BBQ area. Central Exmoor location close to towns of Minehead and Dulverton, lots of picturesque local villages, and local attractions.Electricity paid by meter reading, 25p/unit. Free Internet Access (speeds vary due to rural location). No children under 7 years old as located above Juniper Cottage.The spaceTriscombe Farm is situated in Exmoor National Park within its own valley location. The 10 self catering cottages are in a hamlet-like environment and are mostly converted farm buildings. We are 1 mile away from Wheddon Cross and 10 miles away from Minehead. We are centrally located in Exmoor National Park, ideal for walkers and those looking to explore the area, whilst still being close to nearby towns and villages. Wheddon Cross is the highest village on Exmoor and is close to Dunkery Beacon, the highest point on Exmoor. On a clear day from Dunkery Beacon, you can see for miles around, to Wales and all of the surrounding countryside. There are plenty of places to visit in the area regardless of your interests, whether you want to have an active holiday with watersports, visit National Trust properties, visit family attractions or simply enjoy time away from home. Information about a large number of attractions and places to visit is provided in our online guidebook.The swimming pool uses a  booking system to ensure fair usage of the pool. The link for booking will be sent to guests prior to arrival if the pool is open during your stay (closed until Feb 2024). Please note that we are awaiting new updated photos of the cottages so the photos currently on this listing are pre-covid19 adaptations.Guest accessStream is a private self-contained cottage with access only given to the guests staying in the cottage. We have an emergency key to the cottage which is only used if we need to gain access in an emergency. The swimming pool, games room and gardens are all shared areas, shared only with other guests staying on site and occasional family use. All guests are given keys to the swimming pool and games room, in addition to their individual cottage. Unfortunately we cannot accept bookings that include children under 7 years of age. This is because Stream is situated above Juniper cottage.Other things to note*** N.B. The water supply is Natural Spring Water  (regularly tested) and not SW Water***There are 9 other self catering cottages on site. We do not accept pets as we are a livestock farm but we do have a Labrador called Max (trained to stay away from animals), as well as four farm cats so please be aware that animals live on site. Jake (Black and white male cat) and Mitzi (Tabby female) sometimes come and say hello to guests but should not be let into the cottages. Electricity is charged at 25p/unit to guests during their stay. This is to allow guests to have more control over the cost of their stay and to reduce the risk of electricity being used unnecessarily. The tariff is priced to reflect the additional charge of electricity. Payment is preferable either through AirBnB as an additional service, however alternate methods of payment are available.",

Immediate confirmation and a great addition with no additional fee to use.<br/>Thank you Ruth for a wonderful stay.\",\"Fantastic stay for a family holiday. Beautiful location, spotlessly clean, friendly host. Kids loved the pool and evening barbecues on the hillside. Would recommend and will stay again!\",\"We loved Stream Cottage. It was spotlessly clean on arrival. The shared garden that was beside the property was lovely. We ate breakfast and dinner in the garden using the BBQ space too.<br/>The swimming pool was a great bonus. <br/>Ruth and Becky communicated very well with us. We had a fabulous break and intend to return sometime with our grandchildren.\",\"Lovely place to stay,very peaceful… the children loved the pool and Ruth and Becky were very accommodating to us.<br/>Only a little issue was with the TV signal so we couldn’t watch tv all weekend.. ( not a bad thing ) but two children obviously wanted to watch it, but Becky bought over a lot of DVDS …. X\",\"Amazing cottage for a quiet and peaceful get away. Pool is big and the temperature of water is warm, beds are as comfortable as clouds, massive garden with a bbq area and most importantly nature all around with not a single sound of cars coming by. I would 100% recommend for anyone who wants to get away from a busy city.\",\"Nice enough place. Fairly basic, but fair value and a pretty farm. Quite a lot of rules to contend with/ adjust around, so good if you want to know exactly what to expect/ feel assured that you're totally Covid safe, but possibly not for everyone if you prefer a little more feel of independence.\",\"A+\"]",

Housed 5 guests comfortably for the weekend and Kylie was very helpful in making sure that we knew how to get there and what to do once we had done so.\",\"Perfect stay, highly recommend!\",\"Kylie answered any questions promptly. House had everything we needed. And she was very kind to let us know we could check in early and check out late.\",\"Kylie was a great communicator -  responsive, proactive and helpful. Her place was comfortable for our group which included 4 young children. The extra single mattresses located underneath the bunk beds were great for us. Lockbox check-in was easy and allowed for flexible arrival and departure time. Thanks Kylie!\",\"Perfect space for a couple of families to take a break. <br/>Easy walk to beach, coffee and surroundings.<br/>Excellent communication, everything as described. Felt super comfortable, clean and had everything we could possibly need. <br/>Thank you\",\"Kylie was a great host. Very quick to respond and friendly. <br/>Their home was warm, welcoming and beautifully designed. It was clean with plenty of rooms and good amenities. The location suited us slightly out of the main street,  near the beach and local food places.<br/>Thank you for having us.\",\"Really nice of her to share everything in the kitchen.<br/>We cooked a pasta meal for 6 pax just in 30mins, bought a roasted chicken for $12 from Cole in Cowes. House has heater in both bathrooms to keep warm.<br/>Really good to sleep 8 pax, have living room for <br/>activity. Lots of boardgames for little ones.<br/>Just no WiFi.\",\"Everything as described, great spot.\",\"House was extremely clean. The bnb was warm and cozy. Kylie was a great host, effective communication.\",\"Very comfortable and clean home. Great for our short stay close to Churchill Island and San Remo. Host provided excellent communication before our stay and provided amenities for our use which was very heart warming and I would highly recommend them and use them again in the near future if available.\",\"At Phillip Island for the MOTO GP - a birthday prezzie for my hubby! <br/>The house at Cape Woolamai was perfect - it was clean tidy and pretty much had everything we needed for our 3 night stay! <br/>We had a friend with us so the two bathrooms were a bonus! <br/>The house is walking distance to a parade of shops and a fabulous pub! <br/>A bus stop is also located near the shops with buses to take you around the Island! <br/>We never explored the garden or hot tub as too busy but seating outside in two areas is a bonus also. <br/>Comms with Kylie was easy,  prompt and friendly. <br/>Would highly recommend the house.\",\"Everything was great.\",\"Kylie’s house is great for a getaway. It’s a great size, clean and conveniently located. Walking distance to both the Cape Woolamai shops and the beach. We would happily stay there again.\",\"We enjoyed out stay at Kylie's property over the long weekend. Great location in Cape Woolamai, close to shops and short drive/walks to beach, and is very convenient to visit all attractions in the island. I would recommend this place to any one,  very clean and tidy.\",\"Would recommend Kylie's place.  Communication was great.  House was as described.  Location great for exploring the area and visiting the beaches.  Kitchen was really well stocked and plenty of board games to keep the family amused.  Only drawback was no aircon or fans in the bedrooms.  There is a unit in the living area that kept us all cool, but with the hot, muggy weather, we struggled to sleep at night.\",\"A great location close to shops and beaches. The house is clean and well equiped.\",\"Lovely,  fresh and well laid out house. <br/>Great location - close to shops and beach. <br/>Kylie and Alan were very friendly and helpful. <br/>Highly recommend this stay.\",\"We loved our stay at Kylie’s everything we needed for a comfortable and relaxing stay.

Highly recommended.\",\"I couldn't recommend Kylie's house high enough, It had everything we needed.  It was sparkling clean, with Lots of DVDs'd, Books and games to keep us amused.  Close to everything,   nice stroll to the beach to watch the sunset.   Kylie was easy to communicate with and we certainly felt at home there.  We most definitely will be staying there again if Kylie  will have us.  Thank you Kylie your house is fantastic\",\"Kylie’s place is super lovely.

Great hosts and very helpful! We were allowed to check in a little earlier. <br/>Since we were traveling with 3 small children (2.5 years, 8 months, 6 weeks), the very narrow and steep staircase to the attic was unsuitable (for us). We still managed to do it, but wouldn't go back to this beautiful place until our kids are bigger.\",\"Charming and perfect house to discover Dunkirk, the house is comfortable and very well equipped. The decor is warm. The house is ideally located in the center of Malo les Bains, close to the beach and the beautiful Art Deco villa! The house is easily accessible from the train station by bus\",\"We came with friends for a weekend and we all loved Séverine's house for its style, pretty decor and comfort. Séverine is very responsive and accommodating. The fact that the house is close to a bus stop (free everywhere in Dunkirk) is a real plus. Otherwise, it's only a 10-minute walk to the beautiful beach of Malo-les-Bains.\",\"Large house, well equipped, 15 minutes from Malo les Bains beach.<br/>All parking is free.<br/>Please note, as specified in the listing, the staircase that goes up to the second floor is narrow.<br/>We had a great time.\",\"Lovely cosy home, good parking nearby and a great pizza place\",\"Séverine's house is ideal for visiting the region , meeting with friends and preparing good warm meals after the walk on Malo beach with its beautiful mansions with incredible facades!<br/>Super responsiveness to messages, thoughtfulness and flexibility and… friendly decor + great amenities in the kitchen , what else could I ask for?<br/>Maybe jyste say: thank you Severine for this great rate? \uD83D\uDE1CGo there without a second thought\",\"We had a very pleasant week at Severine's, the accommodation is close to the beach on foot,  we visited the surroundings by walking or by bus (free!) with great pleasure! Severine was understanding and flexible when we had to change our dates. The house is well equipped and functional, nice experience!\",\"The house is very nice, clean and the decoration neat. It's good to sit in the sofas or at the table for relaxing moments with the family. <br/>The kitchen is super well equipped,  nothing is missing, we know the house inhabited and used by its owners. <br/>We spent 5 days with the family and they will remain a great memory.\",\"Apartment well located not far from free buses, not far from the beach with all the shops around.

         "[\"We absolutely loved being at this gorgeous, peaceful villa.   The beds were comfortable, linens perfect, furniture lovely.   The bathrooms were also beautifully tiled and comfortable.    The views out over the olive groves and countryside is beyond beautiful.   But the very best part of staying here was the owners, Albana and Sonny.   Kind, helpful and exquisitely great hosts.   I will be returning again and again to see them, and their gorgeous property.   Thank you both so much, you made our trip for us.\",\"Albana was not there when we arrived, but her husband Andrew greeted us and made us feel welcome. The property is fabulous, meeting all of our expectations and then some! Both Albana and her husband had great suggestions for what to do in the area as well as providing us with great advice on where to park and how to get around in Florence.<br/>It was our first visit to Italy/Tuscany and our only regret was we did not spend enough time just sitting and relaxing at this beautiful property. We sure hope we can make it back here and would love to stay for a longer visit the next time.<br/>We would highly recommend this property and the hosts.<br/>Thank you, Albana!\",\"People who are the epitome of perfection! Nice friendly smile! Our next vacation will be at their place! They're just great! Recommended! I approve! I just have one wish, to go back! All the best to you! And see you next year! For a much longer time! <br/>Best regards, the Legrand family!\",\"Loved out time at Alba’s place! Super comfortable with all the amenities one might need - it felt like home away from home. The AC in the bedrooms worked perfectly, the pool is amazing - Everything is absolutely beautiful. Alba was also an unbelievably gracious host and helped make reservations for us as well as gave the best recommendations to nearby wineries. Definitely recommend and hope to come back and stay again!\",\"Super received, beautiful location. Alba and Andrew were always ready for us, reserved for us restaurants and activities. Super area with super people. Beautiful views.\",\"A very well located place for sightseeing but also to enjoy beautiful views and absolute calm.<br/>The pool is very good.<br/>The amenities are great.<br/>Not to mention the hosts who are very welcoming, offer good advice and give us all the tips for parking and visiting in a practical way.\",\"Alba and Andrew were the perfect hosts: helpful, genuine, welcoming. We highly recommend a stay at their place. The accommodations and grounds were lovely. This stay was the highlight of our trip.\",\"We enjoyed our time at Ponzano so much, it was a very peaceful place to relax and explore the surrounding area. Andrew and Alba were the quintessential hosts who made sure our needs were met and had excellent recommendations and suggestions for navigating the local scene. We also enjoyed the pool and walking through the olive grove. The perfect getaway in Tuscany!\",\"Absolutely stunning. Views that feel like a postcard or movie. The location is super convenient to amazing restaurants, wineries, and cute towns. We loved Barbarino and loved its proximity to the other great cities. The house was spacious and charming. <br/>Alba and Andrew were fantastic hosts. There are people who simply rent you a place to stay and then there are those who \\\"host\\\" in the true sense of the word. Alba and Andrew are the latter and showered us with hospitality. <br/>We will be back!\",\"The accommodations were wonderful. Recommendations for food and sightseeing were unmatched. The scenery was beautiful. Alba and her husband were friendly, interactive and helpful.\",\"We had a wonderful stay at Villa Barberino. Andrew and Alba were available to answer any questions and guide us on making the most of the stunning surroundings. They were also fun to chat with and my kids discovered a common love for music with Andrew. The couple was even kind enough to make reservations for us.<br/>The villa has the quaint charm of typical countryside homes but is well equipped with modern amenities. It is very well maintained and extremely clean. Alba had ensured we had all the necessary supplies to have a comfortable stay. The view from the backyard is breathtaking. We would return here without hesitation for our next Tuscany holiday.\",\"It was the best part of my trip to Italy ! <br/>Alba & Andrew were the main jowl of this place, they took good  care of us like family!<br/>I felt like i am in  home honestly.<br/>The place is beyond beautiful the views the surroundings villages ,the calmness of the nights , the beautiful nature , and the suggestion of Alba were on point i am really glad that i took her advices on every place and activity she suggested it was awesome specially the massage in the house it was beautiful to enjoy massage while you enjoying the beautiful surrounding nature \uD83D\uDC4F <br/>The beds are so comfortable i honestly slept like baby !<br/>Loved everything in this place and <br/>For sure will come back again <br/>Thank you Alba& Andrew\",\"Our stay at Alba and Andrew's \\\"Il fienile\\\" was wonderful.  Beautiful sunsets every night - a great location to navigate Tuscany from - especially Florence and Siena.<br/>This lovingly restored facility was a great place to relax and feel totally at home in.  The fact that Alba and Andrew both spoke fluent English helped us to navigate our time in this region well.<br/>We are grateful for the kindness that they shared to our family during our stay.\",\"Amazing home, amazing hosts!  We were welcomed by both Alba and Sonny. Immediately we felt right at home. Both are extremely knowledgeable of the area, places to see as well as restaurants. They were always available when we had questions. We had everything we needed and then some. The home is beautiful, with amazing views. It was a great spot for day trips to surrounding cities, and wineries. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!!\",\"Had a great time at Alba’s place. So welcoming. Beautiful house with a phenomenal view. House had everything we needed, with olive oil made themselves! Super responsive. Thanks so much for your warmth and kindness Alba and Andrew.\",\"We had a wonderful week staying here in this ideal house and location. Splendid views and magical sunsets watches in the private garden. The house was perfect, with all the amenities you would want. Alba and Andrew the hosts were so helpful with recommendations and making reservations for us. They made us feel very welcome. We will definitely be back to visit again.\",\"From the moment we arrived at Alba’s place, we knew we were in for a fabulous stay. Meeting both Alba and Sonny at check in, we were given plenty of local advice and knowledge tailored to our family and the activities we wanted to do. On hand when needed, space and privacy when required, Alba and Sonny where the perfect hosts. This location is exceptional for all that Tuscany has to offer!\",\"Something like a storybook book setting! Alba and Andrew made us feel at home! Would definitely go back again!\",\"Absolutely perfect! Was just the Tuscany experience we were hoping for. Beautiful Villa, beautiful scenery/sunsets and excellent hosts. Only a very short drive to restaurants with exceptional views and the location makes visiting many Tuscany highlights easy and excellent day trips. Hosts were very welcoming and helpful!\",\"La dolce Vita is at Alba and Andrew's place!<br/>Thank you for this break in this spacious house with amazing views of Tuscan. Not to mention the 15m swimming pool which allowed us to do nice laps in order to make up the fruits acquired in the excellent restaurant addresses handed over by Alba.<br/>Alba and Andrew are adorable, very considerate with lots of sincerity.<br/>The geographical location is ideal for discovering Tuscan, its magnificent landscapes as far as the eye can see, identical to those that can be found in Italian paintings, ( refer to the backgrounds of the picture of the Mona Lisa!) also discover Siena, Florence and all villages within a maximum of 45 minutes by car.<br/>The cherry on the cake: Andrew who plays the piano just at the time of our breakfast in the garden!!!<br/>Grazié Millé!<br/>See you again.<br/>Franck\",\"The location is incredible. The fienile apartment itself unbelievable, with a wide view of the rolling hills with olives and vineyards. Spotless, with great amenities (pool, wifi, kitchen, aircon for those who want it). The hosts are incredibly charming, personal - truly wonderful people who make you feel like you've been in the family forever. <br/>Couldn't recommend more highly - can't wait to return.\",\"What an amazing place.  the best view in all of Tuscany and the pool is heaven.  No need to leave ever.  relaxing and we will definitely be back\",\"After a couple weeks traveling during a historic heat wave in Italy, this villa was exactly the peaceful retreat my family needed! We still can’t believe our luck in finding it, because it was absolutely perfect. Alba & Sonny were incredibly kind and helpful, offering suggestions, food, and even helping us get a very last minute dinner reservation. The villa itself was beautiful, with such a thoughtful mix of antique & mid-century decor with lovely art in every corner. It was also spacious, extremely clean, and so comfortable. The garden and views were simply stunning, and the pool was such a treat after hot days exploring. We really wish we could’ve stayed longer, and hope to return someday!\",\"Stunning views and an absolutely beautiful house. Very spacious, it was lovely to be able to unpack and organise our belongings after travelling out of suitcases for 2 weeks. The hosts were great at offering local suggestions and always on hand to help.\"]",

         "[\"I will stay again at this airbnb.  Host was so helpful. Amenities offered were over and above - from shampoo to Q-tips, hair straightener and many, many more !!  After day one, host checked with us to ensure all was well - you could tell our host wanted us to have an outstanding experience - which we did !!  Would rate our stay 6 stars, but rating system only reaches to 5 !!!  Loved this place !!\",\"This was the second time we have rented this property, excellent hostess and accommodations.  Everything you would ever need is made available to you, hostess checked in to see how we were doing and if everything was going smoothly.  We entertained a fair bit during the week and everyone was very impressed with the property.  Surprisingly there were very few bugs or mosquitos, not sure if that is due to timing of our stay or proactive measures taken by Shelley.   The deck can be confined if you have little kids running around, which we did.  Would not hesitate to return!!\",\"Shelly’s place was fantastic! It’s spacious and extremely cozy from the nice couch for lounging to the comfy beds and bedding in the bedrooms. Feels like home with all the beautiful plants inside and out and nice to have laundry, bbq, and a kitchen with lots of dishes utensils. The deck is gorgeous and great for toddlers too with gates and umbrellas. This is the perfect place to getaway for a few days and enjoy nature. Nice little beach nearby and right next to beautiful Granite hills golf course. Everything is well stocked and felt very clean and inviting. Shelly is very responsive and accommodating. We hope to be back again next year!\",\"The most well stocked cabin we’ve ever stayed in as could not think of one more thing we would’ve needed. Shelly is a very friendly host and very responsive to any questions or needs you have would definitely stay here again.\",\"The cabin was very nicely appointed, everything from kitchen utensils to garden furniture to firewood.  It exceeded our expectations as far as what was provided, extras like kitchen spices.  Host was very amiable, always there if needed and kept in touch to make sure things went as planned.  Lots of parking, beds and linens were fantastic.  Loved the kitchen island for serving up breakfast.  Deck furniture was very comfortable for the afternoon, bonfire with the group was fantastic.  Very happy with everything, look forward to next year if available.\",\"My friend and I absolutely loved our stay. The place was beautiful and in excellent condition. The nicest  AirBnB I have stayed in by far! It was refreshing to say somewhere that matched the pictures.<br/>Shelly was super friendly, helpful and responsive as a host. <br/>Location was great for my friend and I as we were looking for a quiet winter getaway.\",\"Thank you Shelly!! We had a fabulous week away! Your place is beautiful, inviting, has everything we needed to feel right at home.  Your place exceeded our expectations! You are a fabulous host and always quick to respond to any concern.  Definitely would love to go back next summer! It's a perfect getaway and so close to get in some golfing. Thank you!!\",\"What a wonderful cabin, great  space to spend a week and relax with the family.<br/>The cabin was well kept and the furniture and beds were very comfortable, clean linens and lots of blankets to cozy up together and watch a movie. The outdoor space was great, nice private back yard with a fire pit to sit around and roast marshmallows. <br/>The cabin had all the amenities you would need, the only thing that would make this place better is if there was a nice beach within walking distance.\",\"A wonderful place to stay! We picked this spot for the golf course and it was so close. It was a beautiful place that exceeded expectations. Everything was clean and the kitchen was fully functional which made it easy to cook. The couch is so comfy and lots of throw blankets to get cozy. It was the perfect spot to take our 1 year old for the week.\",\"Shelly’s place is as amazing as advertised! She has thoughtfully stocked the cabin with some extras (shampoo, tinfoil, a spice cupboard) and don’t forget something for the dogs (beds and a super fun toy box!). She is very responsive to questions and concerns and responds very quickly! I would recommend her place in a heartbeat for a wonderful getaway!!\",\"Highly recommend Shelly’s home. Beautiful, clean, comfortable and well stocked with everything you could possibly need. Beautiful, quiet location and Shelly was a dream to work with. 5 stars isn’t nearly enough. Shelly has thought of everything!  We will definitely be back. It was the perfect spot for a week away with our adult children and their dogs. The beds are so comfortable, the living room is large and open with lots of room for visiting and some board games. It’s the perfect get away spot. Thanks Shelly for sharing your beautiful home with us and allowing us to make some wonderful family memories!\",\"Beautiful home! The house was comfortable, clean, and incredibly well equipped with extra little touches here and there that made our stay feel special. Communication with Shelly was fantastic. We are looking forward to staying again in the future.\",\"Our second visit to Shelly’s beautiful lake home. Enjoyed bonfire pit, walking, and all the amenities of this location and cottage. Would definitely recommend.\",\"Beautiful home, very spacious. LOVED the 3 bathrooms. Shelly thought of several little extras, and the spice cupboard is incredible. Quiet neighbourhood, we went for walks every day. And if you need anything the store is only 2 minutes away by car. Water is non-potable so a bit of a hassle but water cooler jugs are provided.\",\"A fabulous open concept house in a convenient location to Granite Hills Golf Course, boat launch access and hiking trails.  The spacious indoor and outdoor spaces are set up beautifully for socializing with family and friends or carving out some quiet time.  Shelly is a most attentive host.  If any questions should arise, her response time is impeccable.  Highly recommend this accommodation. We will definitely book again. Be sure to make time to float the Pinawa Channel.<br/>T&D\",\"Shelly was very accomodating all througout our stay. She responded quickly to my messages and provided us with all the informations we need a head of time. Her place is super nice, clean, and tidy. My friends and I really had an amazing time to bond during our stay.  We are definitely coming back again.\",\"Granite hills/Lac du Bonnet/Pinawa area is a beautiful and heavily forested part of the province, there's no shortage of hiking nearby as well as several boat launches.<br/>The cabin is well maintained, clean, air conditioned, and located close to a convenience store and boat launch. We brought our dog and had a great overall experience. <br/>The great trail is a short drive away, and there are numerous connecting hikes to enjoy the Canadian shield and views of the lake and Winnipeg River system. The old pinawa Dam makes for great pictures as well.\",\"This place was amazballz! If you sled, boat, fish, definitely a great place to be. Area is fun, and would recommend 100 times over. Cabin was very cozy. We miss it already.\",\"We just spent 9 nights at Shelly’s place to enjoy snowmobiling with family and friends on the beautiful trails in the area. Shelly’s Communication before and during our stay was prompt and kind. We were led to feel this was our home away from home. We were able to use the detached garage to store our snowmobiles which was appreciated since we had some -30 to -40 nights.  The place was clean, spacious, inviting and plenty of space, well stocked with necessities and linens/bedding/toiletries were plentiful. We appreciated that our dog was welcome.  We would absolutely book Shelly’s place again for a winter staycation!\",\"We rent a vacation home every year and this is by far the best one. Friendly owner, clean place, and absolutely pet-friendly. Comfy beds, fully equipped kitchen, and awesome patio furnitures. We really enjoyed our stay, and definitely recommend this place for your vacation.\",\"Very clean with everything you could want/need.  Fantastic communication and accommodation by Shelly!\",\"Beautiful cabin with a very relaxing setting. Everything was as promised. We highly recommend this rental!!\",\"Very comfortable, clean and well appointed home. We would rent again.\"]",

There was a terrible smell coming from the front portion of the unit for the entire stay. The neighbors were very loud at night which made it very difficult to sleep at night. Me and my girlfriend felt very unsafe not only because of the neighbors, but there was multiple occasions where police were called to the building as well and constant fire alarms. I believe these are issues that need to be brought to the customers attention before check in and I felt they weren’t transparent with these issues.\",\"Great place to stay, close to Square One. The apartment has complete amenities. Maryam was very helpful and quick to respond to all inquiries.\",\"Great place to stay if you are looking for a nice cozy place with great amenities like the gym, sauna, swimming pool, and a jacuzzi. The place is very central, restaurants are close by, the mall is very close, great groceries stores near by. The host is very nice and organized, quick response and correlation.

         "[\"Spacious home near the water. Check in and check out was key transfer from George and wife with tour of house and garden. Super nice people.\",\"Very cozy home\",\"If you want to relax in green surroundings, it's ideal. Absolutely only 50 meters from lovely beach with rocks, but with sandals in a lovely place to swim.<br/>Only downside is a disturbance at night : barking dogs and motorcycles.\",\"A little paradise – the best Airbnb experience in Greece!<br/>We have stayed in many places in Greece, but nothing beats the experience with George and his wonderful wife! Their house is very special-a little oasis filled with charm, tranquility, and personality. We were greeted with a warmth and hospitality that you rarely experience. George and his wife are arguably the most welcoming and sweetest hosts we have met on our trip:) <br/>The garden is like taken out of an adventure-with free-range hens, cute rabbits, and scented fruit trees everywhere. You can pick fresh fcitrons and oranges right from the trees and enjoy them in the shade under a pergola, while the hens calmly step by. It's all so peaceful and authentic that you immediately feel at home.<br/>The house is neat, clean, and decorated with love for the details-nothing is missing. Here's a very special atmosphere that just makes you ever want to leave again.<br/>If you're looking for a real, Greek experience with heart and soul – then book here!\",\"George and his wife are nice people who come to pick you up at the church, and take you to the house. A beautiful old characteristic house with garden (including chickens and rabbits). Close to the sea with beautiful sunset (no beach).\",\"An excellent stay in this pleasant house, bordered by a very beautiful garden. By the sea, with shops nearby... perfect! Thank you for the very warm welcome\",\"We urgently needed a place to stay and the house host was very responsive. We felt like a grandma's in the cottage, it was fun, we had a great night's sleep, and in the morning we had a coffee in the backyard by the trees of orange and lemon, something great! Next to the sea, and it was very nice to walk and look for pebbles :) <br/>The hosts of the house are wonderful! Incredibly nice people with open hearts❤️ Other than that we got a  bag of oranges and lemons from their orchard \uD83C\uDF3B\",\"Mr. George was very helpful with the house and the check-in process. The house is nice with a beautiful garden and in a good location. We recommend it!\",\"We loved to visit this traditional Greek house. George and his wife were wonderful, very kind and helpful. Contact during our stay was perfect. The house is nearby a mini supermarket and bakery, and of course Patras. The only downside were a few dogs in the neighborhood that were sounding alarm during the night\",\"Nice house, great people.\",\"A beautiful little house. It personally brought us memories of a classic house in the village with the retro classic furnishings. Clean and with renovated bathroom. Courtyard for the kids and relax. Thank you.\",\"Exceptional people. The house is very comfortable and clean. We were absolutely delighted and definitely recommend it!!!!\",\"The hosts are indeed very friendly and kind, resposive and etc... I think this could be a good place for short stop-by (1-2) days. And what we think also is that it's not suitable for the winter, it's frieking cold, we stayed with the jackets all the time - there's a heater in one of the rooms and an air-conditioner in the other but they could not heat the whole place enough especially ifyou gonna stay for a day or two. The backyard seems indeed very nice for the summer, but we didn't use it unforetunately. Another drawback could be the parking (because of the old narrow greek streets), as we had to park nearby - not a problem for us but good to know by others so they could decide\",\"Very responsive host, spacious house next to the sea, we had a good night!\",\"For a group of 3 people, the stay was great.\",\"We spent two beautiful days here with the family. We were fantastic food in the evening thanks to the host's restaurant recommendation.\",\"What a fantastic place! A lovley typical greek house, with a lovely garden. George and his family was a terrific host, very friendly and kind. The kids got to help George feed the chickens, turkey an rabbits. The house was also really close to the sea, perfect to take a morning or night swim. George responeded fast to our proposals, and was easy to communicate with. A charming small village. Would absloutely recommend a stay here!\",\"The owners very very nice, really very friendly and welcoming. <br/>Beautiful house, backyard with very good space, quiet area and not far from the beach. Very close to the city of Patras (if you are by car of course) <br/>We got our money <br/>I will give a 5/5 to the owners really spectacular people.\",\"We stayed for one night and it was great. The house is about half an hour from the airport so it is very convenient.  George and his wife gave us a warm and pleasant welcome.\",\"Nice house with a patio at both the front and the back.<br/>We slept well, AC in the bedroom that worked well. We were only 2 people but the house had several bedrooms and plenty of room for more. It was close to the water for a swim, if you want an organized beach with sun loungers and umbrellas, there is not in the village., we drove to a beach called Aloha beach about 15 km from there that was nice <br/>We had good souvlaki at the village tavern.<br/>Close also to bakery and Minimarket<br/>Good value for money.\",\"George and Eugénia are very welcoming and full of good advice. I highly recommend this place and these people!\",\"Small house impassing for one night, very welcoming host, we had a nice stay.\",\"We had a wonderful stay at George's place. He and his wife were so kind and the house was nice and clean. He also let us park our motorbikes in the courtyard. Totally recommended!\",\"really special place. very nice people.  Rustic traditional Greek home. special experience for the kids. good place to get a local country side feel. kids loved the chickens and rabbits in the garden.\"]",

         "[\"Place was easy to find, clean, good communication from hosts and about how to get there. The WiFi network was basically unusable for 90% of tbe stay but otherwise everything was exactly as described\",\"The apartment was very well located in the heart of Alfama with many local cafes and restaurants within a few minutes walk! For a couple it’s perfect for a weekend away, just what you need for a short trip. The apartment was clean and tidy, and the aircon was much appreciated! Would 100% stay again!\",\"Sizable studio that was great for a solo traveler. Heads up, Ubers won’t be able to drop you off directly so you’ll have a 2-3 narrow and short streets to cross. Great coffee spots nearby. Appreciated the AC in the hot hot heat. Hugo and team were super accommodating when I have to extend a day. Highly recommend!\",\"We had a great time at Hugo’s place. It was centrally located; we enjoyed walking to most places/attractions, clean, safe, quiet, and self check in was easy. We would definitely stay there again. Thanks!\",\"This is a decent tiny studio flat in a really fun location - you have to wind through a maze of little alleys in Alfama to reach the building (with very clear instructions from the hosts so not a problem to find). The bed is comfortable and the studio has air conditioning. The bathroom is tiny, anyone on the larger side would probably struggle with it. Lots of eateries, bakeries, cafes, and bars in the surrounding streets.\",\"Bright and quiet studio tucked away in a little alley in Alfama.  Easy walk to public transport, restaurants, mini marts.  Felt very safe, even at night.  I was able to do my laundry.  Would recommend!\",\"Perfect combination of cool antiquity and modern comfort<br/>Great location in a quiet corner of the busy and charming neighborhood Alfama.<br/>We loved the place and enjoyed our stay.<br/>Professional and kind hosts<br/>Highly recommended\",\"The place was good. Apartment felt very practical.<br/>We were not able to find plug for the sink or sponge/brush for washing dishes.<br/>Other than that it had everything we needed and well equipped.\",\"Excellent location, very easy to reach accommodation thanks to clear and detailed instructions. <br/>Very responsive host. <br/>The only downside was that the wifi didn't work and the cleanliness of the bathroom. For the rest, everything was perfect. The location is a real plus, everything is within walking distance! Be careful, you have to be in good shape because there are a lot of stairs! But charming corner and the studio has all the features. A big plus for the responsiveness of the hosts. I really recommend this place!\",\"Perfect space for a couple who want to feel the energy of living in Lisbon's most charming neighborhood. Having the experience of walking through the alleys, going up and down the stairs, taking a cable car, funicular, visiting the many overlooks and finally enjoying the vibration of nightlife in the various local restaurants. Spectacular!!!!\",\"Great stay in Lisbon!<br/>The apartment is perfectly located for visiting everything on foot. The neighborhood is very cute and the location is super quiet, no noise at night. We were able to sleep perfectly. <br/>The studio is small but cute and really functional so it was just perfect. <br/>If you want an apartment in a good location for visiting and quiet for sleeping at night, go for it!\",\"Very good stay. The accommodation is well located, in the historic district of Lisbon, in a small inner courtyard (quiet). Many nearby restaurants, pastelerias and shops.<br/>Flexible check-in was a plus compared to our arrival times, and the instructions left by the host beforehand were clear and helpful (with highly valuable recommendations on transport and catering).<br/>The accommodation is small but well furnished, ideal for a stay for 2 as we did, and very clean. The bedding was good quality.\",\"Small listing as advertised <br/>Super Clean<br/>The bed linen smelled like laundry which is very nice <br/>Adelaide and Hugo were very attentive to the messages sent <br/>Their explanation and advice were very helpful in finding the accommodation and making our stay fun and enjoyable <br/>I highly recommend this place for 2 people\",\"Top\",\"The flat is very similar to the pictures, the neighborhood is nice, but it is very hard to find the flat without a GPS.<br/>Communication with the host was easy and smooth.\",\"Wonderful stay! Great space for a short visit. Good communication and helpful host! Thank you very much!\",\"The host and team have excellent communication and a very timely response. I was allowed to check in when I arrived around 9, for which I'm grateful. The place is small but efficient and clean. Location is a little difficult to find just because it's in the oldest part of the city. Unfortunately, that particular area is very dirty. Be prepared to dodge dog poop. I don't know if there's anything host can do as a community member to improve the cleanliness of the surrounding area.\",\"Very good stay in this studio, perfectly matches the photos and very well equipped and clean. The only downside is the presence of a little humidity but which was no problem. We'll be happy to go back!\",\"Great directions to the place. Cute neighborhood and all we needed for my brother and I.\",\"Comfortable studio in the heart of the alamara. It can only be reached on foot but very easy to find and 5 minutes from transportation. The bathroom is not large but well enough! clean and bright. Great stay!\",\"Wonderful apartment in the heart of Alfama\",\"This place has a great location in the Alfama district, perfect for fully enjoying the charm of Lisbon. The apartment is comfortable and well suited for a short stay, such as a weekend.<br/>The only downside is that the owner didn't respond to my messages via email, which made the communication a little complicated. We didn't have access to the wifi network.\",\"The place was really great: very clean, well equipped and conveniently located. You can do anything on foot. The location is also perfect for those looking for calm. Only small tip: provide earplugs, because you sometimes hear people on the upper floors on the stairs. But other than that, everything was perfect. I would recommend it in a second!\",\"Accommodation good quality price. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Very quiet area within Alfama. Close to public transport. The house when you arrive and it has been closed all day you can see the humidity but when ventilating it resolves. Perfect for a couple. For those who have light sleep the garbage is something scandalous but it happens soon on 00.30 and does not last long, at least with the window open. The hosts are very friendly and quick to answer my questions. I would repeat it again.\"]",
